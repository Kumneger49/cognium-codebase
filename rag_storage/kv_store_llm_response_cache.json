The in-app service experience was also redesigned to allow customers to schedule service, access their loaner, track service progress, pay and manage dropoff/pickup. Prospective customers can similarly schedule, locate and test drive a demo vehicle. \n\nBattery, Powertrain & Manufacturing \n\nDespite macroeconomic headwinds, our planned factory shutdowns in Q3 and ongoing ramp at new factories, our average vehicle cost was $\\sim \\$ 37,500$ , and we continue to work to reduce the cost further. For very heavy vehicles, a high voltage powertrain architecture brings notable cost savings, which is why Cybertruck will adopt an 800-volt architecture. \n\nEnergy Storage \n\nEnergy storage deployments increased by $90 \\%$ YoY in Q3 to 4.0 GWh, our highest quarterly deployment ever. Continued growth in deployments was driven by the ongoing ramp of our Megafactory in Lathrop, CA toward full capacity of 40 GWh with the phase two expansion. Production rate improved further sequentially in Q3. \n\nSolar \n\nSolar deployments declined on a sequential and YoY basis to 49 MW. Sustained high interest rates and the end of net metering in California have created downward pressure on solar demand. \n\nServices and Other business \n\nAs our global fleet size grows, our Services and Other business continues to grow successfully, with Supercharging, insurance and body shop & part sales being the core drivers of profit growth YoY. Pay-per-use Supercharging remains a profitable business for the company, even as we scale capital expenditures. Our team is focused on materially expanding Supercharging capacity and further improving capacity management in anticipation of other OEMs joining our network. \n\ne are planning to grow production as quickly as possible in alignment with the $50 \\%$ CAGR target we began guiding to early 2021. In some years we may grow faster and some we may grow slower, depending on a number of factors. For 23, we expect to remain ahead of the long-term $50 \\%$ CAGR with around 1.8 million vehicles for the year. \n\nWe have ample liquidity to fund our product roadmap, long-term capacity expansion plans and other expenses.   \nFurthermore, we will manage the business such that we maintain a strong balance sheet during this uncertain period. \n\nWhile we continue to execute on innovations to reduce the cost of manufacturing and operations, over time, we expect our hardware-related profits to be accompanied by an acceleration of AI, software and fleet-based profits. \n\nCybertruck deliveries remain on track for later this year. In addition, we continue to make progress on our next generation platform. \n\nP H O T O S & C H A R T S \n\nF I N A N C I A L S T A T E M E N T S \n\nWEBCAST INFORMATION \n\nTesla will provide a live webcast of its third quarter 2023 financial results conference call beginning at 4:30 p.m. CT on October 18, 2023 at ir.tesla.com. This webcast will also be available for replay for approximately one year thereafter. \n\nCERTAIN TERMS \n\nWhen used in this update, certain terms have the following meanings. Our vehicle deliveries include only vehicles that have been transferred to end customers with all paperwork correctly completed. Our energy product deployment volume includes both customer units installed and equipment sales; we report installations at time of commissioning for storage projects or inspection for solar projects, and equipment sales at time of delivery. \"Adjusted EBITDA\" is equal to (i) net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before (ii)(a) interest expense, (b) provision for income taxes, (c) depreciation, amortization and impairment and (d) stock-based compensation expense, which is the same measurement for this term pursuant to the performance-based stock option award granted to our CEO in 2018. \"Free cash flow\" is operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Average cost per vehicle is cost of automotive sales divided by new vehicle deliveries (excluding operating leases). “Days sales outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts receivable, net for the period divided by (ii) total revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days payable outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts payable for the period divided by (ii) total cost of revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days of supply” is calculated by dividing new car ending inventory by the relevant quarter’s deliveries and using 75 trading days. Constant currency impacts are calculated by comparing actuals against current results converted nto USD using average exchange rates from the prior period. \n\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION \n\nConsolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non-GAAP basis to supplement our consolidated financial results. Our non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a diluted per share basis (calculated using weighted average shares for GAAP diluted net income (loss) ttributable to common stockholders), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to Tesla’s historical performance as well as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. Management believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non-GAAP information because management uses such information nternally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial ondition and results of operations, so that investors can see through the eyes of Tesla management regarding important financial metrics that Tesla uses to run the business and allowing investors to better understand Tesla’s performance.

\\$1.8B GAAP operating income in Q3 \\$1.9B GAAP net income in Q3 \\$2.3B non-GAAP net income1 in Q3 \n\nOperating cash flow of \\$3.3B in Q3   \nFree cash flow2 of \\$0.8B in Q3   \n\\$3.0B increase in our cash and investments3 QoQ to \\$26.1B \n\nOur main objectives remained unchanged in Q3-2023: reducing cost per vehicle, free cash flow generation while maximizing delivery volumes and continued investment in AI and other growth projects. \n\nOur cost of goods sold per vehicle4 decreased to \\~\\$37,500 in Q3. While production cost at our new factories remained higher than our established factories, we have implemented necessary upgrades in Q3 to enable further unit cost reductions. We continue to believe that an industry leader needs to be a cost leader. \n\nDuring a high interest rate environment, we believe focusing on investments in R&D and capital expenditures for future growth, while maintaining positive free cash flow, is the right approach. Year-to-date, our free cash flow reached \\$2.3B while our cash and investments position continues to improve. \n\nWe have more than doubled the size of our AI training compute to accommodate for our growing dataset as well as our Optimus robot project. Our humanoid robot is currently being trained for simple tasks through AI rather than hard-coded software, and its hardware is being further upgraded. \n\nLastly, with a combined gross profit generation of over \\$0.5B in Q3, our Energy Generation and Storage business and Services and Other business have become meaningful contributors to our profitability. \n\nRevenue \n\nTotal revenue grew $9 \\%$ YoY in Q3 to $\\$ 23,45$ . YoY, revenue was impacted by the following items: \n\n$^ +$ growth in vehicle deliveries   \n$^ +$ growth in other parts of the business   \n- reduced average selling price (ASP) YoY (excluding FX impact)   \n- negative $\\mathsf { F X }$ impact of $\\$ 0.45$ \n\nProfitability \n\nOur operating income decreased YoY to $\\$ 1.8 B$ in Q3, resulting in a $7 . 6 \\%$ operating margin. YoY, operating income was primarily impacted by the following items: \n\n- reduced ASP due to pricing and mix   \n- increase in operating expenses driven by Cybertruck, AI and other R&D projects   \n- cost of production ramp and idle cost related to factory upgrades   \n- negative FX impact   \n$^ +$ growth in vehicle deliveries (despite the margin headwind from underutilization from new factories)   \n$^ +$ lower cost per vehicle and IRA credit benefit   \n$^ +$ gross profit growth in Energy Generation and Storage as well as Services and Other   \n$^ +$ growth in regulatory credit sales \n\nCash \n\nDuring the quarter we brought down several production lines for upgrades at various factories, which led to a sequential decline in production volumes. We made further progress smoothing out the delivery rate across the quarter, with September accounting for ${ \\sim } 4 0 \\%$ of Q3 deliveries this year, compared to September accounting for $\\sim 6 5 \\%$ of Q3 deliveries in 2022. \n\nAt Gigafactory Texas, we began pilot production of the Cybertruck, which remains on track for initial deliveries this year. We are expecting the Model Y production rate in Texas to grow very gradually from its current level as we ramp additional supply chain needs in a cost-efficient manner. Production of our higher density 4680 cell is progressing as planned, and we continue building capacity for cathode production and lithium refining in the U.S. \n\nUS: California, Nevada and Texas \n\nChina: Shanghai \n\nOther than scheduled downtime in Q3, our Shanghai factory has been successfully running near full capacity for several quarters, and we do not expect a meaningful increase in weekly production run rate. Giga Shanghai remains our main export hub. \n\nEurope: Berlin-Brandenburg \n\nModel Y remained the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Europe year-to-date (based on the latest available data as of August). Similar to Texas, further production ramp of Model Y will be gradual. \n\nArtificial Intelligence Software and Hardware \n\nSoftware that safely performs tasks in the real world is the key focus of our AI development efforts. We have commissioned one of the world's largest supercomputers to accelerate the pace of our AI development, with compute capacity more than doubling compared to Q2. Our large installed base of vehicles continues to generate anonymized video and other data used to develop our FSD Capability features. \n\nVehicle and Other Software \n\nAll Tesla rentals through Hertz in the U.S. and Canada now allow Tesla app access, allowing renters to use keyless lock/unlock via phone key, remotely precondition the cabin, track charge status and more. Customers who already have a Tesla Profile will have their settings and preferences seamlessly applied, making the rental car feel like their own. The in-app service experience was also redesigned to allow customers to schedule service, access their loaner, track service progress, pay and manage dropoff/pickup. Prospective customers can similarly schedule, locate and test drive a demo vehicle. \n\nBattery, Powertrain & Manufacturing \n\nDespite macroeconomic headwinds, our planned factory shutdowns in Q3 and ongoing ramp at new factories, our average vehicle cost was $\\sim \\$ 37,\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

Prospective customers can similarly schedule, locate and test drive a demo vehicle. \\n\\nBattery, Powertrain & Manufacturing \\n\\nDespite macroeconomic headwinds, our planned factory shutdowns in Q3 and ongoing ramp at new factories, our average vehicle cost was $\\\\sim \\\\$ 37,500$ , and we continue to work to reduce the cost further. For very heavy vehicles, a high voltage powertrain architecture brings notable cost savings, which is why Cybertruck will adopt an 800-volt architecture. \\n\\nEnergy Storage \\n\\nEnergy storage deployments increased by $90 \\\\%$ YoY in Q3 to 4.0 GWh, our highest quarterly deployment ever. Continued growth in deployments was driven by the ongoing ramp of our Megafactory in Lathrop, CA toward full capacity of 40 GWh with the phase two expansion. Production rate improved further sequentially in Q3. \\n\\nSolar \\n\\nSolar deployments declined on a sequential and YoY basis to 49 MW. Sustained high interest rates and the end of net metering in California have created downward pressure on solar demand. \\n\\nServices and Other business \\n\\nAs our global fleet size grows, our Services and Other business continues to grow successfully, with Supercharging, insurance and body shop & part sales being the core drivers of profit growth YoY. Pay-per-use Supercharging remains a profitable business for the company, even as we scale capital expenditures. Our team is focused on materially expanding Supercharging capacity and further improving capacity management in anticipation of other OEMs joining our network. \\n\\ne are planning to grow production as quickly as possible in alignment with the $50 \\\\%$ CAGR target we began guiding to early 2021. In some years we may grow faster and some we may grow slower, depending on a number of factors. For 23, we expect to remain ahead of the long-term $50 \\\\%$ CAGR with around 1.8 million vehicles for the year. \\n\\nWe have ample liquidity to fund our product roadmap, long-term capacity expansion plans and other expenses.   \\nFurthermore, we will manage the business such that we maintain a strong balance sheet during this uncertain period. \\n\\nWhile we continue to execute on innovations to reduce the cost of manufacturing and operations, over time, we expect our hardware-related profits to be accompanied by an acceleration of AI, software and fleet-based profits. \\n\\nCybertruck deliveries remain on track for later this year. In addition, we continue to make progress on our next generation platform. \\n\\nP H O T O S & C H A R T S \\n\\nF I N A N C I A L S T A T E M E N T S \\n\\nWEBCAST INFORMATION \\n\\nTesla will provide a live webcast of its third quarter 2023 financial results conference call beginning at 4:30 p.m. CT on October 18, 2023 at ir.tesla.com. This webcast will also be available for replay for approximately one year thereafter. \\n\\nCERTAIN TERMS \\n\\nWhen used in this update, certain terms have the following meanings. Our vehicle deliveries include only vehicles that have been transferred to end customers with all paperwork correctly completed. Our energy product deployment volume includes both customer units installed and equipment sales; we report installations at time of commissioning for storage projects or inspection for solar projects, and equipment sales at time of delivery. \\\"Adjusted EBITDA\\\" is equal to (i) net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before (ii)(a) interest expense, (b) provision for income taxes, (c) depreciation, amortization and impairment and (d) stock-based compensation expense, which is the same measurement for this term pursuant to the performance-based stock option award granted to our CEO in 2018. \\\"Free cash flow\\\" is operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Average cost per vehicle is cost of automotive sales divided by new vehicle deliveries (excluding operating leases). “Days sales outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts receivable, net for the period divided by (ii) total revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days payable outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts payable for the period divided by (ii) total cost of revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days of supply” is calculated by dividing new car ending inventory by the relevant quarter’s deliveries and using 75 trading days. Constant currency impacts are calculated by comparing actuals against current results converted nto USD using average exchange rates from the prior period. \\n\\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION \\n\\nConsolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non-GAAP basis to supplement our consolidated financial results. Our non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a diluted per share basis (calculated using weighted average shares for GAAP diluted net income (loss) ttributable to common stockholders), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to Tesla’s historical performance as well as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. Management believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non-GAAP information because management uses such information nternally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial ondition and results of operations, so that investors can see through the eyes of Tesla management regarding important financial metrics that Tesla uses to run the business and allowing investors to better understand Tesla’s performance.

remained unchanged in Q3-2023: reducing cost per vehicle, free cash flow generation while maximizing delivery volumes and continued investment in AI and other growth projects. \\n\\nOur cost of goods sold per vehicle4 decreased to \\\\~\\\\$37,500 in Q3. While production cost at our new factories remained higher than our established factories, we have implemented necessary upgrades in Q3 to enable further unit cost reductions. We continue to believe that an industry leader needs to be a cost leader. \\n\\nDuring a high interest rate environment, we believe focusing on investments in R&D and capital expenditures for future growth, while maintaining positive free cash flow, is the right approach. Year-to-date, our free cash flow reached \\\\$2.3B while our cash and investments position continues to improve. \\n\\nWe have more than doubled the size of our AI training compute to accommodate for our growing dataset as well as our Optimus robot project. Our humanoid robot is currently being trained for simple tasks through AI rather than hard-coded software, and its hardware is being further upgraded. \\n\\nLastly, with a combined gross profit generation of over \\\\$0.5B in Q3, our Energy Generation and Storage business and Services and Other business have become meaningful contributors to our profitability. \\n\\nRevenue \\n\\nTotal revenue grew $9 \\\\%$ YoY in Q3 to $\\\\$ 23,45$ . YoY, revenue was impacted by the following items: \\n\\n$^ +$ growth in vehicle deliveries   \\n$^ +$ growth in other parts of the business   \\n- reduced average selling price (ASP) YoY (excluding FX impact)   \\n- negative $\\\\mathsf { F X }$ impact of $\\\\$ 0.45$ \\n\\nProfitability \\n\\nOur operating income decreased YoY to $\\\\$ 1.8 B$ in Q3, resulting in a $7 . 6 \\\\%$ operating margin. YoY, operating income was primarily impacted by the following items: \\n\\n- reduced ASP due to pricing and mix   \\n- increase in operating expenses driven by Cybertruck, AI and other R&D projects   \\n- cost of production ramp and idle cost related to factory upgrades   \\n- negative FX impact   \\n$^ +$ growth in vehicle deliveries (despite the margin headwind from underutilization from new factories)   \\n$^ +$ lower cost per vehicle and IRA credit benefit   \\n$^ +$ gross profit growth in Energy Generation and Storage as well as Services and Other   \\n$^ +$ growth in regulatory credit sales \\n\\nCash \\n\\nDuring the quarter we brought down several production lines for upgrades at various factories, which led to a sequential decline in production volumes. We made further progress smoothing out the delivery rate across the quarter, with September accounting for ${ \\\\sim } 4 0 \\\\%$ of Q3 deliveries this year, compared to September accounting for $\\\\sim 6 5 \\\\%$ of Q3 deliveries in 2022. \\n\\nAt Gigafactory Texas, we began pilot production of the Cybertruck, which remains on track for initial deliveries this year. We are expecting the Model Y production rate in Texas to grow very gradually from its current level as we ramp additional supply chain needs in a cost-efficient manner. Production of our higher density 4680 cell is progressing as planned, and we continue building capacity for cathode production and lithium refining in the U.S. \\n\\nUS: California, Nevada and Texas \\n\\nChina: Shanghai \\n\\nOther than scheduled downtime in Q3, our Shanghai factory has been successfully running near full capacity for several quarters, and we do not expect a meaningful increase in weekly production run rate. Giga Shanghai remains our main export hub. \\n\\nEurope: Berlin-Brandenburg \\n\\nModel Y remained the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Europe year-to-date (based on the latest available data as of August). Similar to Texas, further production ramp of Model Y will be gradual. \\n\\nArtificial Intelligence Software and Hardware \\n\\nSoftware that safely performs tasks in the real world is the key focus of our AI development efforts. We have commissioned one of the world's largest supercomputers to accelerate the pace of our AI development, with compute capacity more than doubling compared to Q2. Our large installed base of vehicles continues to generate anonymized video and other data used to develop our FSD Capability features. \\n\\nVehicle and Other Software \\n\\nAll Tesla rentals through Hertz in the U.S. and Canada now allow Tesla app access, allowing renters to use keyless lock/unlock via phone key, remotely precondition the cabin, track charge status and more. Customers who already have a Tesla Profile will have their settings and preferences seamlessly applied, making the rental car feel like their own. The in-app service experience was also redesigned to allow customers to schedule service, access their loaner, track service progress, pay and manage dropoff/pickup. Prospective customers can similarly schedule, locate and test drive a demo vehicle. \\n\\nBattery, Powertrain & Manufacturing \\n\\nDespite macroeconomic headwinds, our planned factory shutdowns in Q3 and ongoing ramp at new factories, our average vehicle cost was $\\\\sim \\\\$ 37,\\n\\n---Output---\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla is an electric vehicle manufacturer that operates factories in the US and China, focusing on vehicle production, AI development, and energy generation.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Cybertruck\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"The Cybertruck is a new electric vehicle model from Tesla that is in pilot production at Gigafactory Texas and is expected to have initial deliveries this year.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Gigafactory Texas\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"Gigafactory Texas is a Tesla production facility where the Cybertruck is being piloted for production and is increasing the production rate of the Model Y.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Giga Shanghai\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"Giga Shanghai is Tesla's factory in China, which has been running near full capacity and serves as the main export hub for Tesla vehicles.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Model Y\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Model Y is described as Tesla's best-selling vehicle in Europe year-to-date and is also produced at Gigafactory Texas and Giga Shanghai.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Artificial Intelligence Development\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Artificial Intelligence Development is a key focus area for Tesla involving advancements in software and hardware to improve vehicle functionality.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Free Cash Flow\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Free Cash Flow is a financial metric that Tesla focuses on improving, reaching $2.3 billion year-to-date by managing deliveries and production costs.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"California\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"California is one of the key states in the United States where Tesla operates and conducts business.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Nevada\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"Nevada is another U.S. state relevant to Tesla's operations.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Shanghai\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"Shanghai is the city in China where Tesla's Giga Shanghai factory is located.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla\\\"<|>\\\"Cybertruck\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla is the manufacturer of the Cybertruck, which is currently in pilot production at Gigafactory Texas.\\\"<|>\\\"vehicle production, product development\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Gigafactory Texas\\\"<|>\\\"Cybertruck\\\"<|>\\\"The Cybertruck is being produced at Gigafactory Texas, indicating a direct link between the facility and the vehicle.\\\"<|>\\\"production facility, new model\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Gigafactory Texas\\\"<|>\\\"Model Y\\\"<|>\\\"Production of the Model Y will gradually increase at Gigafactory Texas as Tesla ramps up supply chain needs.\\\"<|>\\\"vehicle production, operational growth\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Giga Shanghai\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla\\\"<|>\\\"Giga Shanghai is owned and operated by Tesla, serving as a crucial site for vehicle production and export.\\\"<|>\\\"manufacturing site, global operations\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Model Y\\\"<|>\\\"Giga Shanghai\\\"<|>\\\"Model Y is also manufactured at Giga Shanghai, which supports its status as the best-selling vehicle in Europe.\\\"<|>\\\"vehicle production, market performance\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla\\\"<|>\\\"Artificial Intelligence Development\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla is making significant investments in AI development as part of its growth strategy for enhancing vehicle capabilities.\\\"<|>\\\"innovation, technology investment\\\"<|>10)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Free Cash Flow\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla's focus on generating free cash flow is linked to its ongoing efforts to improve delivery volumes and reduce costs.\\\"<|>\\\"financial management, operational efficiency\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"financial performance, electric vehicles, production facilities, AI development, growth strategy\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

The x-axis, labeled with time intervals (Q3 2017 to Q3 2023), includes evenly spaced ticks representing each quarter. The y-axis measures market share percentage, ranging from 0% to 4%. The lines are color-coded: blue indicates the US/Canada market share, red represents Europe, and green indicates China. The blue line shows a steady upward trend, suggesting increasing market penetration in the US/Canada. The red line, while also trending upward, does so at a slower rate, indicating Europe's gradual increase in Tesla's market presence. The green line, representing China, shows a more erratic slope, suggesting fluctuating market performance. Lighting is neutral, typical for printed graphs, ensuring the focus remains on the data without distractions from background colors or lighting effects. No actions are depicted, as the image is purely informational.

consecutive quarters, highlighting revenue, profit, expenses, cash flow, and earnings per share. The column headers include 'Q3-2022', 'Q4-2022', 'Q1-2023', 'Q2-2023', and 'Q3-2023,' showcasing the company's financial trajectory over this period. Key data points demonstrate a decline in total gross profit and overall profitability, evidenced by a decrease in net income and earnings per share compared to the prior year. Notably, total revenues in Q3-2023 were reported at \\$23.35 billion, reflecting a 9% YoY growth, primarily driven by automotive revenue growth and energy generation and storage revenue which grew by 40%. Despite this revenue growth, the gross profit fell by 22%, indicating increased costs and pressures on margins due to factors like higher operating expenses related to R&D and production ramp-up at new factories. The table shows that Q3's operating margin dropped to 7.6%, highlighting a significant decline and reflecting the impact of reduced average selling prices and underutilization of production capacity. The relationship between operating expenses and revenues suggests that while revenue generation remains robust, cost management plays a critical role in profitability. Overall, the financial underperformance illustrated in the table aligns with the strategic focus on reducing vehicle costs and investing in growth projects outlined in the surrounding content, indicating an intent to balance investments with profitability management in a challenging economic environment.\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

solutions across several quarters, specifically focusing on Q3 of 2022, Q4 of 2022, Q1 of 2023, Q2 of 2023, and Q3 of 2023. The column headers include time periods and key performance metrics: Model S/X production and deliveries, Model 3/Y production and deliveries, total production and deliveries, solar and storage deployment, and counts of Tesla locations, mobile service fleet, supercharger stations, and supercharger connectors. Key insights reveal significant declines in Model S/X production by 31% YoY, while the Model 3/Y improved by 20%. Total production rose 18% YoY despite the decline in Model S/X. Deliveries mirrored this trend with total deliveries increasing by 27% YoY. Solar deployment faced a drastic decline of 48% YoY, whereas energy storage showed a significant increase of 90%. The growth in service infrastructure is evident through a 25% increase in Tesla locations and a 31% increase in Supercharger stations and connectors, aligning with the strategic goal of enhancing delivery and service capabilities amidst production ramp-ups and a volatile ASP. These data points directly relate to the broader context indicating revenue growth, profitability challenges, and operational adjustments following R&D expenditure and factory upgrades.\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

The overall composition features three lines plotted against a standard horizontal (x-axis) and vertical (y-axis) grid structure. The x-axis, labeled with time intervals (Q3 2017 to Q3 2023), includes evenly spaced ticks representing each quarter. The y-axis measures market share percentage, ranging from 0% to 4%. The lines are color-coded: blue indicates the US/Canada market share, red represents Europe, and green indicates China. The blue line shows a steady upward trend, suggesting increasing market penetration in the US/Canada. The red line, while also trending upward, does so at a slower rate, indicating Europe's gradual increase in Tesla's market presence. The green line, representing China, shows a more erratic slope, suggesting fluctuating market performance. Lighting is neutral, typical for printed graphs, ensuring the focus remains on the data without distractions from background colors or lighting effects.

there may be limitations discovered as production rates approach capacity. Production rates depend on a variety of factors, including equipment uptime, component supply, downtime related to factory upgrades, regulatory considerations and other factors. \n\nAnalysis: The table titled 'Current Installed Annual Vehicle Capacity' provides a structured overview of Tesla's production capabilities across different regions. It comprises four columns: 'Region', 'Model', 'Capacity', and 'Status'. The 'Region' column lists locations such as California, Shanghai, Berlin, Texas, and Nevada, indicating where production is taking place or planned. The 'Model' column details the specific vehicle models, including the Model S, Model X, Model 3, Model Y, Cybertruck, and Tesla Semi. The 'Capacity' column specifies the annual production capacity, with notable figures like over 950,000 for Shanghai's Model 3 and Model Y, and 550,000 for California's Model 3 and Model Y. The 'Status' column reveals whether the vehicles are in active production or in pilot production status. A significant insight is the 'Pilot production' status for the Cybertruck and Tesla Semi, indicating that Tesla is gradually ramping production in response to supply chain optimizations mentioned in the surrounding context. This aligns with the company’s strategic focus on increasing production rates while managing factory upgrades efficiently. The relationships highlighted in the data suggest that Tesla is heavily investing in its production capacity, especially in regions critical to its operations, such as Shanghai, which serves as a major hub for exports. The connection between production capacity and strategic delivery goals is also evident—given that the production rates play a critical role in meeting customer demand and achieving delivery targets, as illustrated by the reduction in the percentage of Q3 deliveries in September compared to the previous year. Ultimately, the table underscores Tesla's ambitious plans amidst various operational challenges and is integral to understanding how Tesla intends to align production with its long-term objectives.\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

five consecutive quarters, highlighting revenue, profit, expenses, cash flow, and earnings per share. The column headers include 'Q3-2022', 'Q4-2022', 'Q1-2023', 'Q2-2023', and 'Q3-2023,' showcasing the company's financial trajectory over this period. Key data points demonstrate a decline in total gross profit and overall profitability, evidenced by a decrease in net income and earnings per share compared to the prior year. Notably, total revenues in Q3-2023 were reported at \\\\$23.35 billion, reflecting a 9% YoY growth, primarily driven by automotive revenue growth and energy generation and storage revenue which grew by 40%. Despite this revenue growth, the gross profit fell by 22%, indicating increased costs and pressures on margins due to factors like higher operating expenses related to R&D and production ramp-up at new factories. The table shows that Q3's operating margin dropped to 7.6%, highlighting a significant decline and reflecting the impact of reduced average selling prices and underutilization of production capacity. The relationship between operating expenses and revenues suggests that while revenue generation remains robust, cost management plays a critical role in profitability. Overall, the financial underperformance illustrated in the table aligns with the strategic focus on reducing vehicle costs and investing in growth projects outlined in the surrounding content, indicating an intent to balance investments with profitability management in a challenging economic environment.\\n\\n---Output---\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Company\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"The Company is referenced in the analysis as a corporation reporting its quarterly financial performance with key metrics such as revenues, profits, and expenses.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Q3-2023\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Q3-2023 is the specific quarter for which the Company is reporting financial results.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Q3-2022\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Q3-2022 is the previous year’s quarter used for year-over-year comparisons in the Company’s financial performance.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Total Revenues\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Total Revenues refer to the cumulative income generated by the Company, reported as \\\\$23.35 billion for Q3-2023 with a 9% YoY growth.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Automotive Revenue\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Automotive Revenue is a part of the total revenues and has shown significant growth, contributing to the overall increase.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Energy Generation and Storage Revenue\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Energy Generation and Storage Revenue is a segment of the Company's revenue that grew by 40% in Q3-2023 compared to the previous year.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Company\\\"<|>\\\"Q3-2023\\\"<|>\\\"The analysis discusses the Company’s financial performance for Q3-2023, highlighting key metrics from this particular reporting period.\\\"<|>\\\"financial performance, reporting period\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Company\\\"<|>\\\"Q3-2022\\\"<|>\\\"The financial results presented for Q3-2023 are being compared to the previous year's Q3-2022 to evaluate YoY performance.\\\"<|>\\\"year-over-year comparison, financial analysis\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Total Revenues\\\"<|>\\\"Automotive Revenue\\\"<|>\\\"Automotive Revenue is a significant contributor to the Company’s Total Revenues as noted in the financial analysis.\\\"<|>\\\"revenue sources, financial metrics\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Total Revenues\\\"<|>\\\"Energy Generation and Storage Revenue\\\"<|>\\\"Energy Generation and Storage Revenue is part of the Total Revenues and has experienced notable growth in the latest report.\\\"<|>\\\"revenue segments, performance growth\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"financial performance, revenue analysis, quarterly report, economic environment, profitability management\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

and there may be limitations discovered as production rates approach capacity. Production rates depend on a variety of factors, including equipment uptime, component supply, downtime related to factory upgrades, regulatory considerations and other factors. \\n\\nAnalysis: The table titled 'Current Installed Annual Vehicle Capacity' provides a structured overview of Tesla's production capabilities across different regions. It comprises four columns: 'Region', 'Model', 'Capacity', and 'Status'. The 'Region' column lists locations such as California, Shanghai, Berlin, Texas, and Nevada, indicating where production is taking place or planned. The 'Model' column details the specific vehicle models, including the Model S, Model X, Model 3, Model Y, Cybertruck, and Tesla Semi. The 'Capacity' column specifies the annual production capacity, with notable figures like over 950,000 for Shanghai's Model 3 and Model Y, and 550,000 for California's Model 3 and Model Y. The 'Status' column reveals whether the vehicles are in active production or in pilot production status. A significant insight is the 'Pilot production' status for the Cybertruck and Tesla Semi, indicating that Tesla is gradually ramping production in response to supply chain optimizations mentioned in the surrounding context. This aligns with the company’s strategic focus on increasing production rates while managing factory upgrades efficiently. The relationships highlighted in the data suggest that Tesla is heavily investing in its production capacity, especially in regions critical to its operations, such as Shanghai, which serves as a major hub for exports. The connection between production capacity and strategic delivery goals is also evident—given that the production rates play a critical role in meeting customer demand and achieving delivery targets, as illustrated by the reduction in the percentage of Q3 deliveries in September compared to the previous year. Ultimately, the table underscores Tesla's ambitious plans amidst various operational challenges and is integral to understanding how Tesla intends to align production with its long-term objectives.\\n\\n---Output---\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla is an automotive company focused on electric

The column headers include time periods and key performance metrics: Model S/X production and deliveries, Model 3/Y production and deliveries, total production and deliveries, solar and storage deployment, and counts of Tesla locations, mobile service fleet, supercharger stations, and supercharger connectors. Key insights reveal significant declines in Model S/X production by 31% YoY, while the Model 3/Y improved by 20%. Total production rose 18% YoY despite the decline in Model S/X. Deliveries mirrored this trend with total deliveries increasing by 27% YoY. Solar deployment faced a drastic decline of 48% YoY, whereas energy storage showed a significant increase of 90%. The growth in service infrastructure is evident through a 25% increase in Tesla locations and a 31% increase in Supercharger stations and connectors, aligning with the strategic goal of enhancing delivery and service capabilities amidst production ramp-ups and a volatile ASP.

The x-axis is labeled with the quarters, displaying Q3 2022, Q4 2022, Q1 2023, Q2 2023, and Q3 2023. The y-axis displays the cost in USD, ranging from $36,000 to $40,000. Each bar is color-coded, with Q3 2022, Q4 2022, Q1 2023, and Q2 2023 represented by blue bars, while Q3 2023 is highlighted in red, indicating a significant decrease in costs. The red bar is noticeably lower than the previous bars, which illustrates the company's decreasing trend in costs over time.

On the left side, the y-axis titled 'Vehicle Deliveries (millions of units)' ranges from 0 to 0.5, depicting the number of vehicle deliveries from Q4 2020 through Q3 2023. The bars, which are a deep blue, illustrate a steady increase over the quarters, with noticeable spikes in certain periods. On the right side, two distinct metrics—Operating Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow—are displayed, both measured in billions of dollars. The y-axis on this side ranges from 0 to 6. The Operating Cash Flow, represented by taller blue bars, shows fluctuations across quarters, peaking in Q2 2022 and Q3 2022. Meanwhile, the Free Cash Flow, depicted in a maroon hue, experiences lower counts, revealing a more erratic pattern. Each bar has labels for the respective quarters, clearly marked beneath each grouping. The overall color scheme is professional with a muted background, emphasizing the blue and maroon bars.

The bars increase gradually, starting from approximately 0.2 million units in Q4 2020 to about 2 million units in Q3 2023, displaying a steady upward trend. The bars are colored in various shades of blue. Below this graph, the x-axis is labeled with the respective quarters, while the y-axis indicates the number of deliveries. On the right graph, another vertical bar chart displays 'Operating Cash Flow' and 'Free Cash Flow' measured in billions of dollars during the same quarterly periods. The blue bars represent Operating Cash Flow, while the maroon bars depict Free Cash Flow. There are noticeable fluctuations in both cash flow metrics, with Operating Cash Flow showing more significant variations compared to Free Cash Flow. The x-axis labels the quarters, and the y-axis indicates the cash flow amounts. The two graphs are both in a clean, minimalist style with a white background and clearly legible axis labels. The overall color scheme is primarily blue, with maroon accents for the second graph.\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

There are three distinct lines representing the revenue growth for each entity: Tesla is shown in a bold red, the Auto Industry in gray, and the S&P 500 in blue. The red line starts below the gray line in Q3 2019, dips and shows volatility, then peaks significantly around Q2 2021 before declining again towards Q3 2023, reflecting Tesla's sharp growth trajectory followed by a reduction. The gray line representing the Auto Industry maintains a flatter, steadier progression, peaking mildly around the same time as Tesla, but without the same volatility. The blue line for the S&P 500 hovers consistently above the other two lines with minor fluctuations, indicating overall stable growth relative to Tesla and the Auto Industry. The colors used are contrasting, with a clean, minimalistic style that emphasizes clarity. There are no labels directly marking the lines but the colors correspond clearly with the legends implied by their colors.

The overall composition is a vertical bar chart with two distinct colors: light blue for Net Income and dark red for Adjusted EBITDA. Each x-axis label denotes a quarter from Q4 2020 to Q3 2023, presented in chronological order. The y-axis scales from 0 to 20 in increments of 2, allowing easy visualization of the financial metrics. The light blue bars indicating Net Income are shorter than the overlapping dark red bars signifying Adjusted EBITDA across most quarters, which are distinctively higher, particularly noticeable in recent quarters. The chart appears well-lit, with an emphasis on clarity and simplicity, allowing for straightforward interpretation of the data trends.

The vertical axis measures percentage growth, marked from -20% to 90%, while the horizontal axis is divided into quarterly time intervals over the specified period. There are three distinct lines representing the revenue growth for each entity: Tesla is shown in a bold red, the Auto Industry in gray, and the S&P 500 in blue. The red line starts below the gray line in Q3 2019, dips and shows volatility, then peaks significantly around Q2 2021 before declining again towards Q3 2023, reflecting Tesla's sharp growth trajectory followed by a reduction. The gray line representing the Auto Industry maintains a flatter, steadier progression, peaking mildly around the same time as Tesla, but without the same volatility. The blue line for the S&P 500 hovers consistently above the other two lines with minor fluctuations, indicating overall stable growth relative to Tesla and the Auto Industry. The colors used are contrasting, with a clean, minimalistic style that emphasizes clarity. There are no labels directly marking the lines but the colors correspond clearly with the legends implied by their colors. The graph is informative, encapsulating Tesla’s performance against industry standards and stock market performance, relevant to financial statements for stakeholders.\\n\\n---Output---\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla is an automobile manufacturer that has shown significant revenue growth from Q3 2019 to Q3 2023, with notable volatility in its growth trajectory.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Auto Industry\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The Auto Industry represents the broader sector of automobile manufacturers, demonstrating a steadier progression in revenue growth compared to Tesla.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"S&P 500\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The S&P 500 is a stock market index that represents the performance of 500 of the largest companies in the U.S., showing consistent growth and stability during the same period.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla\\\"<|>\\\"Auto Industry\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla's revenue growth is compared to the Auto Industry, indicating how it performs relative to its peers in the market.\\\"<|>\\\"market comparison, performance analysis\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla\\\"<|>\\\"S&P 500\\\"<|>\\\"The performance of Tesla is analyzed against the S&P 500, illustrating its fluctuations relative to the general market trend.\\\"<|>\\\"market performance, financial analysis\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Auto Industry\\\"<|>\\\"S&P 500\\\"<|>\\\"The Auto Industry's revenue growth is contrasted with that of the S&P 500, highlighting stability in the broader market versus sector-specific volatility.\\\"<|>\\\"industry stability, market trend\\\"<|>6)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"revenue growth, financial performance, market comparison, volatility, stability\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

The financial statement presented in the table captures Tesla's performance data across several key metrics over the five most recent quarters (Q3-2022 to Q3-2023). The table is structured with column headers indicating time periods in the fiscal year, while the first column lists significant financial components such as total revenues, gross profit, and net income. Notable data points include total revenues peaking at $24,927 million in Q2-2023 before declining to $23,350 million in Q3-2023, indicating a potential seasonal trend. Cost of revenues mirrors this pattern, with automotive sales costs stabilizing around $15,656 million in Q3-2023. Furthermore, net income reflects considerable fluctuations; it sharply dropped from $3,292 million in Q3-2022 to $1,853 million in Q3-2023, suggesting operational challenges or increased expenditures. The detail on net income per share, both basic and diluted, reveals discrepancies in earnings attributable to shared ownership during this period. This exploration of Tesla’s financial metrics is significant in highlighting the impact of operational choices and market pressures on profitability within the evolving landscape of the electric vehicle sector, making these insights pertinent to investors and stakeholders who analyze overarching financial trends.\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

Q3-2022 to Q3-2023. The first column lists various cash flow activities, including 'Net income', 'Depreciation', 'Adjustments', and others, indicating the source and application of cash. The second to sixth columns represent quarterly figures, revealing notable trends. Key insights include a consistent decline in net income from Q3-2022 (3,331) to Q3-2023 (1,878), a slight increase in cash from operational activities at Q3-2023 (3,308) compared to Q2-2023 (3,065), and a notable escalatory trend in capital expenditures reaching (2,460) in Q3-2023. Additionally, financing activities show fluctuating patterns with a positive net flow of 254 in Q3-2023. The relationships among net income, operational cash flow, and capital expenditures suggest that increasing investments could be impacting net income negatively. Therefore, examining how expenditures correlate with net income decreases may yield insights for strategic adjustments going forward.\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

Column headers indicate date references for financial metrics, and rows summarize various asset types, liabilities, and shareholders' equity. Notable insights reveal increasing total current assets, particularly cash equivalents rising from 21.107 million USD to 26.077 million USD (Q3 2023), and a fluctuating inventory which peaked at 14.375 million USD in Q1 2023 before dropping back to 13.721 million USD by Q3 2023. Total liabilities show a consistent increase over the quarters, culminating in 39.446 million USD by Q3 2023, while total stockholders' equity demonstrated robust growth from 39.851 million USD to 53.466 million USD in the same period, indicating a strengthening financial position. The days sales outstanding remained relatively stable, signaling efficient accounts receivable management, while days payable outstanding saw some variances, indicating fluctuations in payment terms with suppliers.

financial information for Tesla Inc. for the third quarter of 2022 through the third quarter of 2023, shown in millions of USD except per share data. The organization is structured chronologically by quarter with columns specified for each reporting period (Q3-2022 to Q3-2023). Key headers include 'Net income attributable to common stockholders (GAAP)', 'Stock-based compensation expense', and 'Total revenues'. Notable patterns include a decline in GAAP net income from Q2-2023 to Q3-2023, dropping from 2,703 million to 1,853 million USD. Stock-based compensation also shows a consistent increase, reflecting the company's retention strategies. The Adjusted EBITDA margin fluctuates but notably improves in Q3-2023 at 16.1%. Significant trends reveal a stark decline in net income over the quarters while adjusted figures fluctuate around retained earnings. The relationship between net income and stock-based compensation suggests a conscious resource allocation towards incentivizing employees while navigating reduced earnings. These insights indicate strategic decisions during periods of declining profitability, highlighting actions taken by Tesla to maintain operational stability while addressing investor expectations.\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

None\\n\\nAnalysis: The financial statement presented in the table captures Tesla's performance data across several key metrics over the five most recent quarters (Q3-2022 to Q3-2023). The table is structured with column headers indicating time periods in the fiscal year, while the first column lists significant financial components such as total revenues, gross profit, and net income. Notable data points include total revenues peaking at $24,927 million in Q2-2023 before declining to $23,350 million in Q3-2023, indicating a potential seasonal trend. Cost of revenues mirrors this pattern, with automotive sales costs stabilizing around $15,656 million in Q3-2023. Furthermore, net income reflects considerable fluctuations; it sharply dropped from $3,292 million in Q3-2022 to $1,853 million in Q3-2023, suggesting operational challenges or increased expenditures. The detail on net income per share, both basic and diluted, reveals discrepancies in earnings attributable to shared ownership during this period. This exploration of Tesla’s financial metrics is significant in highlighting the impact of operational choices and market pressures on profitability within the evolving landscape of the electric vehicle sector, making these insights pertinent to investors and stakeholders who analyze overarching financial trends.\\n\\n---Output---\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla is an electric vehicle manufacturer that is evaluated based on its financial performance over several quarters.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Q3-2022\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Q3-2022 is the third quarter of the fiscal year 2022, indicating a timeframe for Tesla's financial performance data.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Q4-2022\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Q4-2022 is the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2022, used as a reference point in Tesla's financial metrics analysis.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Q1-2023\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Q1-2023 is the first quarter of the fiscal year 2023, providing further context for Tesla's financial performance data.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Q2-2023\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Q2-2023 is the second quarter of the fiscal year 2023, during which Tesla's total revenues peaked.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Q3-2023\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Q3-2023 is the third quarter of the fiscal year 2023, denoting the latest reporting period for Tesla's financial results.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Total Revenues\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Total Revenues reflect Tesla's earnings from operations, which reached a peak of $24,927 million in Q2-2023.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Net Income\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Net Income indicates Tesla's profitability, showing a drop from $3,292 million in Q3-2022 to $1,853 million in Q3-2023.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Cost of Revenues\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Cost of Revenues pertains to expenses incurred by Tesla in generating its revenue, stabilizing around $15,656 million in Q3-2023.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla\\\"<|>\\\"Total Revenues\\\"<|>\\\"Total Revenues are a key financial metric for Tesla, reflecting its operational success and revenue generation over reported quarters.\\\"<|>\\\"financial performance, revenue generation\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla\\\"<|>\\\"Net Income\\\"<|>\\\"Net Income is a critical indicator of Tesla's profitability, providing insight into its financial health over time.\\\"<|>\\\"profitability, operational performance\\\"<|>10)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Total Revenues\\\"<|>\\\"Q2-2023\\\"<|>\\\"Total Revenues peaked in Q2-2023, indicating a significant financial performance during that quarter.\\\"<|>\\\"financial peak, operational success\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Net Income\\\"<|>\\\"Q3-2023\\\"<|>\\\"Net Income reflects significant fluctuations, particularly showcasing a decline in Q3-2023 compared to previous quarters.\\\"<|>\\\"financial fluctuations, profitability decline\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Cost of Revenues\\\"<|>\\\"Total Revenues\\\"<|>\\\"Cost of Revenues directly impacts Total Revenues, influencing Tesla's gross profitability metrics.\\\"<|>\\\"cost management, revenue relationship\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla, financial performance, revenue trends, profitability, electric vehicle sector\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

financial information for Tesla Inc. for the third quarter of 2022 through the third quarter of 2023, shown in millions of USD except per share data. The organization is structured chronologically by quarter with columns specified for each reporting period (Q3-2022 to Q3-2023). Key headers include 'Net income attributable to common stockholders (GAAP)', 'Stock-based compensation expense', and 'Total revenues'. Notable patterns include a decline in GAAP net income from Q2-2023 to Q3-2023, dropping from 2,703 million to 1,853 million USD. Stock-based compensation also shows a consistent increase, reflecting the company's retention strategies. The Adjusted EBITDA margin fluctuates but notably improves in Q3-2023 at 16.1%. Significant trends reveal a stark decline in net income over the quarters while adjusted figures fluctuate around retained earnings. The relationship between net income and stock-based compensation suggests a conscious resource allocation towards incentivizing employees while navigating reduced earnings. These insights indicate strategic decisions during periods of declining profitability, highlighting actions taken by Tesla to maintain operational stability while addressing investor expectations.\\n\\n---Output---\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla Inc.\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla Inc. is an organization that reports its financial information and is involved in the automotive and energy sectors.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Q3-2022\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Q3-2022 marks a financial reporting period for Tesla Inc. displaying net income and other metrics for stakeholders.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Q4-2022\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Q4-2022 represents another financial reporting period for Tesla Inc., showcasing changes in their financial metrics.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Q1-2023\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Q1-2023 indicates a financial reporting period highlighting Tesla's performance metrics.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Q2-2023\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Q2-2023 reflects a financial reporting timeframe for Tesla Inc. with its associated metrics.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Q3-2023\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Q3-2023 signifies a recent financial reporting period for Tesla Inc., revealing current operational data.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders (GAAP)\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders is a standard accounting measure showing Tesla Inc.'s profitability.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Total Revenues\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Total revenues indicate the overall income generated by Tesla Inc. during respective financial periods.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Stock-Based Compensation Expense\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Stock-based compensation expense refers to the costs associated with equity incentives granted to Tesla's employees.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla Inc.\\\"<|>\\\"Q3-2022\\\"<|>\\\"Q3-2022 is a financial reporting period presented in Tesla Inc.'s financial statements.\\\"<|>\\\"financial reporting, performance evaluation\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla Inc.\\\"<|>\\\"Q4-2022\\\"<|>\\\"Q4-2022 is a subsequent financial reporting period for Tesla Inc., indicating ongoing performance trends.\\\"<|>\\\"financial reporting, performance evaluation\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla Inc.\\\"<|>\\\"Q1-2023\\\"<|>\\\"Q1-2023 denotes another key financial reporting period crucial for assessing Tesla Inc.'s business progress.\\\"<|>\\\"financial reporting, performance evaluation\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla Inc.\\\"<|>\\\"Q2-2023\\\"<|>\\\"Q2-2023 is the reporting period highlighting Tesla Inc.'s performance and strategic decision-making.\\\"<|>\\\"financial reporting, performance evaluation\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla Inc.\\\"<|>\\\"Q3-2023\\\"<|>\\\"Q3-2023 reflects the latest financial reporting period illustrating Tesla Inc.'s financial health and operational strategies.\\\"<|>\\\"financial reporting, performance evaluation\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders (GAAP)\\\"<|>\\\"Q2-2023\\\"<|>\\\"The GAAP net income from Q2-2023 shows Tesla Inc.'s profitability for that period, informing stakeholders of earnings performance.\\\"<|>\\\"profitability assessment, financial metrics\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders (GAAP)\\\"<|>\\\"Q3-2023\\\"<|>\\\"The GAAP net income for Q3-2023 represents a decline, indicating key financial trends for Tesla Inc.\\\"<|>\\\"profitability assessment, financial metrics\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Total Revenues\\\"<|>\\\"Q3-2023\\\"<|>\\\"Total revenues in Q3-2023 highlight Tesla Inc.'s income generation efforts within the given financial period.\\\"<|>\\\"revenue assessment, financial metrics\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Stock-Based Compensation Expense\\\"<|>\\\"Q3-2023\\\"<|>\\\"Stock-based compensation in Q3-2023 reflects Tesla Inc.'s resource allocation for employee retention despite fluctuating profits.\\\"<|>\\\"compensation strategy, employee incentives\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla Inc., financial reporting, GAAP, non-GAAP, income metrics, strategic decisions\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

from Q3-2022 to Q3-2023. The first column lists various cash flow activities, including 'Net income', 'Depreciation', 'Adjustments', and others, indicating the source and application of cash. The second to sixth columns represent quarterly figures, revealing notable trends. Key insights include a consistent decline in net income from Q3-2022 (3,331) to Q3-2023 (1,878), a slight increase in cash from operational activities at Q3-2023 (3,308) compared to Q2-2023 (3,065), and a notable escalatory trend in capital expenditures reaching (2,460) in Q3-2023. Additionally, financing activities show fluctuating patterns with a positive net flow of 254 in Q3-2023. The relationships among net income, operational cash flow, and capital expenditures suggest that increasing investments could be impacting net income negatively.

None\n\nAnalysis: The table presents a reconciliation of GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) to non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) financial information for Tesla from Q1 2020 to Q3 2023. It is structured in a straightforward format with two primary data columns: financial metrics (rows) such as 'Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities', 'Free cash flow', and 'Adjusted EBITDA', and corresponding values indicating financial performance in millions of USD for multiple quarters. Key data points include a steady increase in net income attributable to common stockholders, which rose from $16 million in Q1 2020 to $2,703 million in Q3 2023. This significant growth pattern illustrates improving profitability over time, which correlates with the context of Tesla's strong market position and production ramp-up in electric vehicles. Trends indicate fluctuations in capital expenditures and consistent growth in adjusted EBITDA, peaking at $5,404 million in Q2 2023, showcasing operational efficiency. The data serves to support surrounding content discussing Tesla's robust growth amid market uncertainties and increasing demand for electric vehicles, and the importance of understanding both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for a comprehensive view of financial health.\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

The table consists of two main sections: Assets and Liabilities & Equity, detailing the financial position across different periods. Column headers indicate date references for financial metrics, and rows summarize various asset types, liabilities, and shareholders' equity. Notable insights reveal increasing total current assets, particularly cash equivalents rising from 21.107 million USD to 26.077 million USD (Q3 2023), and a fluctuating inventory which peaked at 14.375 million USD in Q1 2023 before dropping back to 13.721 million USD by Q3 2023. Total liabilities show a consistent increase over the quarters, culminating in 39.446 million USD by Q3 2023, while total stockholders' equity demonstrated robust growth from 39.851 million USD to 53.466 million USD in the same period, indicating a strengthening financial position.

The columns reflect various quarters, with headers indicating specific financial figures: Net cash provided by operating activities, Capital expenditures, Free cash flow, Net income attributable to common stockholders, Interest expense, Provision for income taxes, Depreciation, amortization and impairment, Stock-based compensation expense, and Adjusted EBITDA. Significant data points include steady increases in net income, peaking at USD 12,556 million in Q4 2022 before slight declines in subsequent quarters. Capital expenditures rose notably in Q1 2022, reflecting investment in expansion. Free cash flow shows volatility, impacted by operational changes and capital outlays. Key trends exhibit Tesla's growth trajectory, notably its increasing adjusted EBITDA, indicative of improving operational efficiency. The relationship between net income and capital expenditures highlights Tesla’s investment strategy in scaling production capacity against growing market demand for electric vehicles. These insights contextualize Tesla's future outlook amidst the discussion of live earnings webcasts and non-GAAP financial disclosures, illustrating how transparent financial reporting supports investor confidence and corporate management strategies. The table captures pivotal metrics that reinforce Tesla's financial stability and adaptability in a competitive landscape, aligning with the surrounding context of future developments and financial disclosures.\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

None\\n\\nAnalysis: The table presents a reconciliation of GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) to non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) financial information for Tesla from Q1 2020 to Q3 2023. It is structured in a straightforward format with two primary data columns: financial metrics (rows) such as 'Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities', 'Free cash flow', and 'Adjusted EBITDA', and corresponding values indicating financial performance in millions of USD for multiple quarters. Key data points include a steady increase in net income attributable to common stockholders, which rose from $16 million in Q1 2020 to $2,703 million in Q3 2023. This significant growth pattern illustrates improving profitability over time, which correlates with the context of Tesla's strong market position and production ramp-up in electric vehicles. Trends indicate fluctuations in capital expenditures and consistent growth in adjusted EBITDA, peaking at $5,404 million in Q2 2023, showcasing operational efficiency. The data serves to support surrounding content discussing Tesla's robust growth amid market uncertainties and increasing demand for electric vehicles, and the importance of understanding both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for a comprehensive view of financial health.\\n\\n---Output---\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla is a company that showcases significant growth in net income and operational efficiency in the electric vehicle market from Q1 2020 to Q3 2023.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"GAAP\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"GAAP stands for Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and is used as a standard framework for financial reporting in the analysis.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"non-GAAP\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Non-GAAP refers to financial reporting metrics that offer additional insights into a company's performance beyond GAAP measures.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Net Income\\\"<|>\\\"financial metric\\\"<|>\\\"Net income attributable to common stockholders increased significantly from $16 million in Q1 2020 to $2,703 million by Q3 2023, indicating profitability growth.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Free Cash Flow\\\"<|>\\\"financial metric\\\"<|>\\\"Free cash flow is a measure of financial health, indicating the cash a company generates after accounting for capital expenditures.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Adjusted EBITDA\\\"<|>\\\"financial metric\\\"<|>\\\"Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, reaching a peak of $5,404 million in Q2 2023.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Capital Expenditures\\\"<|>\\\"financial metric\\\"<|>\\\"Capital expenditures reflect the investment in physical assets and showed fluctuations through the periods analyzed.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla\\\"<|>\\\"GAAP\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla's financial performance is analyzed using GAAP metrics, highlighting its adherence to accounting standards in reporting.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla\\\"<|>\\\"non-GAAP\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla's financial health is further depicted through non-GAAP metrics, providing a comprehensive view of its operational performance.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Net Income\\\"<|>\\\"Adjusted EBITDA\\\"<|>\\\"The increase in net income correlates with the rising adjusted EBITDA, showcasing Tesla's improving profitability and operational efficiency.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Free Cash Flow\\\"<|>\\\"Capital Expenditures\\\"<|>\\\"Free cash flow analysis shows the ability of Tesla to invest in capital expenditures while maintaining positive operational cash flow.\\\")##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla financial analysis, GAAP, non-GAAP, profitability, operational efficiency, electric vehicles\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

None\\n\\nAnalysis: The table presents a comprehensive quarterly financial overview of Tesla from Q4 2020 to Q3 2023, delineating key financial metrics crucial to understanding the operational and financial health of the company. The columns reflect various quarters, with headers indicating specific financial figures: Net cash provided by operating activities, Capital expenditures, Free cash flow, Net income attributable to common stockholders, Interest expense, Provision for income taxes, Depreciation, amortization and impairment, Stock-based compensation expense, and Adjusted EBITDA. Significant data points include steady increases in net income, peaking at USD 12,556 million in Q4 2022 before slight declines in subsequent quarters. Capital expenditures rose notably in Q1 2022, reflecting investment in expansion. Free cash flow shows volatility, impacted by operational changes and capital outlays. Key trends exhibit Tesla's growth trajectory, notably its increasing adjusted EBITDA, indicative of improving operational efficiency. The relationship between net income and capital expenditures highlights Tesla’s investment strategy in scaling production capacity against growing market demand for electric vehicles. These insights contextualize Tesla's future outlook amidst the discussion of live earnings webcasts and non-GAAP financial disclosures, illustrating how transparent financial reporting supports investor confidence and corporate management strategies.

The in-app service experience was also redesigned to allow customers to schedule service, access their loaner, track service progress, pay and manage dropoff/pickup. Prospective customers can similarly schedule, locate and test drive a demo vehicle.\n\nBattery, Powertrain & Manufacturing\n\nDespite macroeconomic headwinds, our planned factory shutdowns in Q3 and ongoing ramp at new factories, our average vehicle cost was ~$37,500, and we continue to work to reduce the cost further.

Our humanoid robot is currently being trained for simple tasks through AI rather than hard-coded software, and its hardware is being further upgraded.\n\nLastly, with a combined gross profit generation of over $0.5B in Q3, our Energy Generation and Storage business and Services and Other business have become meaningful contributors to our profitability.\n\n(1)  Excludes SBC (stock-based compensation)\n\n(2)  Free cash flow = operating cash flow less capex\n\n(3)  Includes cash, cash equivalents and investments\n\n(4)  Calculated by dividing Cost of Automotive Sales Revenue by respective quarter's new deliveries (ex-operating leases)\n\nF I N A N C I A L S U M M A R Y (Unaudited)\n\n4\n\nF I N A N C I A L S U M M A R Y\n\nRevenue\n\nTotal revenue grew 9% YoY in Q3 to $23.4B.

YoY, operating income was primarily impacted by the following items:\n\n- reduced ASP due to pricing and mix\n\n- increase in operating expenses driven by Cybertruck, AI and other R&D projects\n\n- cost of production ramp and idle cost related to factory upgrades\n\n- negative FX impact\n\n+ growth in vehicle deliveries (despite the margin headwind from underutilization from new factories)\n\n+ lower cost per vehicle and IRA credit benefit\n\n+ gross profit growth in Energy Generation and Storage as well as Services and Other\n\n+ growth in regulatory credit sales\n\nQuarter-end cash, cash equivalents and investments increased sequentially by $3.0B to $26.1B in Q3, driven by financing activities of $2.3B and free cash flow of $0.8B.\n\nProfitability\n\nCash\n\n5\n\n(1)  Impact is calculated on a constant currency basis.

This count now includes all sales, service, delivery and body shop locations globally. 6\n\nV E H I C L E C A P A C I T Y\n\nDuring the quarter we brought down several production lines for upgrades at various factories, which led to a sequential decline in production volumes. We made further progress smoothing out the delivery rate across the quarter, with September accounting for ~40% of Q3 deliveries this year, compared to September accounting for ~65% of Q3 deliveries in 2022.\n\nUS: California, Nevada and Texas\n\nAt Gigafactory Texas, we began pilot production of the Cybertruck, which remains on track for initial deliveries this year. We are expecting the Model Y production rate in Texas to grow very gradually from its current level as we ramp additional supply chain needs in a cost-efficient manner. Production of our higher density 4680 cell is progressing as planned, and we continue building capacity for cathode production and lithium refining in the U.S.\n\nChina: Shanghai\n\nOther than scheduled downtime in Q3, our Shanghai factory has been successfully running near full capacity for several quarters, and we do not expect a meaningful increase in weekly production run rate. Giga Shanghai remains our main export hub.\n\nEurope: Berlin-Brandenburg\n\nModel Y remained the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Europe year-to-date (based on the latest available data as of August).

Our vehicle deliveries include only vehicles that have been transferred to end customers with all paperwork correctly completed. Our energy product deployment volume includes both customer units installed and equipment sales; we report installations at time of commissioning for storage projects or inspection for solar projects, and equipment sales at time of delivery. \"Adjusted EBITDA\" is equal to (i) net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before (ii)(a) interest expense, (b) provision for income taxes, (c) depreciation, amortization and impairment and (d) stock-based compensation expense, which is the same measurement for this term pursuant to the performance-based stock option award granted to our CEO in 2018. \"Free cash flow\" is operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Average cost per vehicle is cost of automotive sales divided by new vehicle deliveries (excluding operating leases). 'Days sales outstanding' is equal to (i) average accounts receivable, net for the period divided by (ii) total revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. 'Days payable outstanding' is equal to (i) average accounts payable for the period divided by (ii) total cost of revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. 'Days of supply' is calculated by dividing new car ending inventory by the relevant quarter's deliveries and using 75 trading days. Constant currency impacts are calculated by comparing actuals against current results converted into USD using average exchange rates from the prior period.\n\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\n\nConsolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non-GAAP basis to supplement our consolidated financial results. Our non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a diluted per share basis (calculated using weighted average shares for GAAP diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Tesla's historical performance as well as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. Management believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non-GAAP information because management uses such information internally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations, so that investors can see through the eyes of Tesla management regarding important financial metrics that Tesla uses to run the business and allowing investors to better understand Tesla's performance. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be read in conjunction with financial information reported under U.S. GAAP when understanding Tesla's operating performance. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is provided above.\n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nCertain statements in this update, including statements in the 'Outlook' section; statements relating to the future development, ramp, production and capacity, demand and market growth, cost, pricing and profitability, investment, deliveries, deployment, availability and other features and improvements and timing of existing and future Tesla products and technologies such as Model 3, Model Y, Model X, Model S, Cybertruck, our next generation vehicle platform, our Dojo training computers, our Autopilot, Full Self-Driving and other vehicle software and AI enabled products, our battery cells, our Supercharging network and our energy storage and solar products; statements regarding operating margin, operating profits, spending and liquidity;\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

continued investment in AI and other growth projects.\\n\\nOur cost of goods sold per vehicle 4 decreased to ~$37,500 in Q3. While production cost at our new factories remained higher than our established factories, we have implemented necessary upgrades in Q3 to enable further unit cost reductions. We continue to believe that an industry leader needs to be a cost leader.\\n\\nDuring a high interest rate environment, we believe focusing on investments in R&D and capital expenditures for future growth, while maintaining positive free cash flow, is the right approach. Year-to-date, our free cash flow reached $2.3B while our cash and investments position continues to improve.\\n\\nWe have more than doubled the size of our AI training compute to accommodate for our growing dataset as well as our Optimus robot project. Our humanoid robot is currently being trained for simple tasks through AI rather than hard-coded software, and its hardware is being further upgraded.\\n\\nLastly, with a combined gross profit generation of over $0.5B in Q3, our Energy Generation and Storage business and Services and Other business have become meaningful contributors to our profitability.\\n\\n(1)  Excludes SBC (stock-based compensation)\\n\\n(2)  Free cash flow = operating cash flow less capex\\n\\n(3)  Includes cash, cash equivalents and investments\\n\\n(4)  Calculated by dividing Cost of Automotive Sales Revenue by respective quarter's new deliveries (ex-operating leases)\\n\\nF I N A N C I A L S U M M A R Y (Unaudited)\\n\\n4\\n\\nF I N A N C I A L S U M M A R Y\\n\\nRevenue\\n\\nTotal revenue grew 9% YoY in Q3 to $23.4B.

We are expecting the Model Y production rate in Texas to grow very gradually from its current level as we ramp additional supply chain needs in a cost-efficient manner. Production of our higher density 4680 cell is progressing as planned, and we continue building capacity for cathode production and lithium refining in the U.S.\\n\\nChina: Shanghai\\n\\nOther than scheduled downtime in Q3, our Shanghai factory has been successfully running near full capacity for several quarters, and we do not expect a meaningful increase in weekly production run rate. Giga Shanghai remains our main export hub.\\n\\nEurope: Berlin-Brandenburg\\n\\nModel Y remained the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Europe year-to-date (based on the latest available data as of August).

This webcast will also be available for replay for approximately one year thereafter.\\n\\nCERTAIN TERMS\\n\\nWhen used in this update, certain terms have the following meanings. Our vehicle deliveries include only vehicles that have been transferred to end customers with all paperwork correctly completed. Our energy product deployment volume includes both customer units installed and equipment sales; we report installations at time of commissioning for storage projects or inspection for solar projects, and equipment sales at time of delivery. \\\"Adjusted EBITDA\\\" is equal to (i) net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before (ii)(a) interest expense, (b) provision for income taxes, (c) depreciation, amortization and impairment and (d) stock-based compensation expense, which is the same measurement for this term pursuant to the performance-based stock option award granted to our CEO in 2018. \\\"Free cash flow\\\" is operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Average cost per vehicle is cost of automotive sales divided by new vehicle deliveries (excluding operating leases). 'Days sales outstanding' is equal to (i) average accounts receivable, net for the period divided by (ii) total revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. 'Days payable outstanding' is equal to (i) average accounts payable for the period divided by (ii) total cost of revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. 'Days of supply' is calculated by dividing new car ending inventory by the relevant quarter's deliveries and using 75 trading days. Constant currency impacts are calculated by comparing actuals against current results converted into USD using average exchange rates from the prior period.\\n\\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\\n\\nConsolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non-GAAP basis to supplement our consolidated financial results. Our non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a diluted per share basis (calculated using weighted average shares for GAAP diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Tesla's historical performance as well as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. Management believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non-GAAP information because management uses such information internally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations, so that investors can see through the eyes of Tesla management regarding important financial metrics that Tesla uses to run the business and allowing investors to better understand Tesla's performance. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be read in conjunction with financial information reported under U.S. GAAP when understanding Tesla's operating performance. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is provided above.\\n\\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\\n\\nCertain statements in this update, including statements in the 'Outlook' section; statements relating to the future development, ramp, production and capacity, demand and market growth, cost, pricing and profitability, investment, deliveries, deployment, availability and other features and improvements and timing of existing and future Tesla products and technologies such as Model 3, Model Y, Model X, Model S, Cybertruck, our next generation vehicle platform, our Dojo

    "return": "Free Cash Flow (FCF) is a critical financial metric that reflects the cash generated by a company after accounting for capital expenditures (CapEx) necessary to maintain or expand its asset base. This metric is essential for assessing a company's financial health and indicates the cash available for discretionary spending, such as dividends, share repurchases, or reinvestment in business operations.\n\nFor Tesla, a company that has been emphasizing the improvement of its Free Cash Flow, the metric reached $2.3 billion year-to-date by effectively managing production costs and vehicle deliveries. However, in the third quarter of 2023, Tesla recorded a Free Cash Flow of $(2.46) billion, highlighting a cash outflow for that period. This figure is derived by subtracting capital expenditures from operating cash flow, revealing the cash available after covering operational expenses and required investments in infrastructure or technology.\n\nWhile Free Cash Flow generally shows less variability than Operating Cash Flow, its measurements can still exhibit an erratic pattern, particularly during periods of significant investment or operational shifts. For example, despite the larger year-to-date figure, the quarterly FCF was reported at $0.8 billion in Q3 2023, which emphasizes the fluctuations that can occur in relation to capital expenditures.\n\nOverall, Free Cash Flow serves as a vital indicator of the cash that a company like Tesla can utilize for growth, shareholder returns, and financial stability, reflecting both the operational efficiency and strategic investment decisions made by the firm.",

structured overview of key topics in a Q3 2023 update regarding the company's performance. It is organized into two columns, one displaying various topics (rows labeled 'Highlights', 'Financial Summary', 'Operational Summary', 'Vehicle Capacity', 'Core Technology', 'Other Highlights', 'Outlook', 'Photos & Charts', 'Key Metrics', 'Financial Statements', 'Additional Information') and the other providing a corresponding index. The topics reflect a comprehensive assessment of financial metrics, operational achievements, and future outlooks, reinforcing the themes of profitability and ongoing investment in innovation as stated in the surrounding content. Notable insights include an operational efficiency exemplified by a 7.6% operating margin, discussions on production capacities, and a robust cash position with $26.1B in investments and cash. The low cost of goods sold per vehicle indicates potential for improved profit margins, aligning with the company's focus on cost leadership during high interest rates. The table's structured format supports and complements the narrative surrounding corporate performance and strategic objectives in Q3 2023.\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

It is organized into two columns, one displaying various topics (rows labeled 'Highlights', 'Financial Summary', 'Operational Summary', 'Vehicle Capacity', 'Core Technology', 'Other Highlights', 'Outlook', 'Photos & Charts', 'Key Metrics', 'Financial Statements', 'Additional Information') and the other providing a corresponding index. The topics reflect a comprehensive assessment of financial metrics, operational achievements, and future outlooks, reinforcing the themes of profitability and ongoing investment in innovation as stated in the surrounding content. Notable insights include an operational efficiency exemplified by a 7.6% operating margin, discussions on production capacities, and a robust cash position with $26.1B in investments and cash. The low cost of goods sold per vehicle indicates potential for improved profit margins, aligning with the company's focus on cost leadership during high interest rates.

They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, Nexon Technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment.

The y-axis ranges from -200 to 200, divided into increments of 50, showcasing values that fluctuate between negative and positive gross profits. The bars are shaded in a deep reddish hue, enhancing visibility against the white background. Notably, there are periods of loss indicated by negative bars, especially prominent in 2017 through 2019. However, a gradual rise in profit is observable from 2020 onward, culminating in a significant surge in Q3 2023. The time axis features quarter labels that are tilted to ensure readability.

The state names and respective prices are written in a bold, sans-serif font, predominantly in blue, which contrasts against the lighter background. States like New York, Pennsylvania, and Maryland are detailed with their prices listed next to them. Notably, Colorado is showcased with a price of $31,490, while most states exhibit higher figures ranging from $32,490 to $36,490. The bottom left corner states '$36,490 in all other states' in a bold black font for emphasis. The lighting is uniform, with no stark contrasts, contributing to a clean and professional visual style, indicative of corporate reports.

The leftmost chart illustrates 'Vehicle Deliveries' in millions of units, featuring blue bars depicting each quarter's delivery numbers, which show a general upward trend over time. The central chart portrays 'Operating Cash Flow' and 'Free Cash Flow' measured in billions of dollars, with blue bars for Operating Cash Flow and maroon bars for Free Cash Flow, noting a positive disparity in figures, especially in recent quarters. The rightmost chart captures 'Net Income' and 'Adjusted EBITDA', similarly color-coded, illustrating a steady increase in both categories across the same time frame. The chart backgrounds are light with a clean presentation, enhancing readability. All charts utilize consistent axis labels and units, affirming their comparative nature. The overall color palette favors blues and maroons against a white background, creating a professional, corporate feel. The visual layout emphasizes a clear progression in financial health and operational performance, directly correlating with the surrounding context related to significant metrics of the automotive industry, specifically regarding product output and financial success.\\n\\n---Output---\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla is a vehicle manufacturing company noted for its upward trend in vehicle deliveries, operating cash flow, free cash flow, net income, and adjusted EBITDA between Q4-2020 and Q3-2023.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Vehicle Deliveries\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Vehicle Deliveries refers to the units of vehicles delivered by Tesla, showing a general upward trend over specified quarters.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Operating Cash Flow\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Operating Cash Flow indicates the cash generated from Tesla's core business operations, with positive figures noted in recent quarters.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Free Cash Flow\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Free Cash Flow measures the cash available to Tesla after accounting for capital expenditures, showing a positive disparity in recent quarters.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Net Income\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Net Income is the profit of Tesla after all expenses, exhibiting a steady increase over the analyzed quarters.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Adjusted EBITDA\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Adjusted EBITDA reflects Tesla's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, showing a steady rise in the same timeframe.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla\\\"<|>\\\"Vehicle Deliveries\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla's upward trend in vehicle deliveries signifies its strong sales performance within the automotive industry.\\\"<|>\\\"sales performance, growth\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla\\\"<|>\\\"Operating Cash Flow\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla's positive operating cash flow indicates its strong core operational performance as reflected in financial metrics.\\\"<|>\\\"financial health, operational performance\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla\\\"<|>\\\"Free Cash Flow\\\"<|>\\\"The positive disparity in free cash flow highlights Tesla's ability to manage expenses and invest in growth.\\\"<|>\\\"financial management, investment capacity\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla\\\"<|>\\\"Net Income\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla's steady increase in net income illustrates its growing profitability over time.\\\"<|>\\\"profitability, financial success\\\"<|>10)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla\\\"<|>\\\"Adjusted EBITDA\\\"<|>\\\"The increase in adjusted EBITDA indicates improving operational efficiency and profit margins for Tesla.\\\"<|>\\\"operational efficiency, financial metrics\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"automotive industry, financial metrics, Tesla, growth trajectory, operational performance\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

The graph consists of three lines representing the performance of Tesla (red), the overall Auto Industry (grey), and the S&P 500 (blue). The x-axis is labeled with time intervals spanning from Q3 2019 to Q3 2023, while the y-axis ranges from -20% to 90%. Tesla's line prominently showcases sharp fluctuations, peaking above 40% in Q2 2021 but exhibiting a gradual decline reaching below 10% by Q3 2023. The Auto Industry's line remains more stable, typically below 10%, with minor increases. The S&P 500 line shows consistent growth, fluctuating around 10% to 20%. The contrasting colors and bold lines help in easily distinguishing each data set. The graph's aesthetic is clean and professional, using a light background to enhance readability as data points are plotted. There are no other objects or text elements present in the image, allowing focused interpretation of the trending lines and their respective implications for investors and analysts. The data illustrates Tesla's significant shifts against the backdrop of industry averages and broader market trends, making it a compelling visual narrative about its performance relative to competitors and the economy.\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

three distinct performance metrics over time from Q3 2019 to Q3 2023. The graph consists of three lines representing the performance of Tesla (red), the overall Auto Industry (grey), and the S&P 500 (blue). The x-axis is labeled with time intervals spanning from Q3 2019 to Q3 2023, while the y-axis ranges from -20% to 90%. Tesla's line prominently showcases sharp fluctuations, peaking above 40% in Q2 2021 but exhibiting a gradual decline reaching below 10% by Q3 2023. The Auto Industry's line remains more stable, typically below 10%, with minor increases. The S&P 500 line shows consistent growth, fluctuating around 10% to 20%. The contrasting colors and bold lines help in easily distinguishing each data set. The graph's aesthetic is clean and professional, using a light background to enhance readability as data points are plotted. There are no other objects or text elements present in the image, allowing focused interpretation of the trending lines and their respective implications for investors and analysts. The data illustrates Tesla's significant shifts against the backdrop of industry averages and broader market trends, making it a compelling visual narrative about its performance relative to competitors and the economy.\\n\\n---Output---\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla is an automotive and energy company known for its electric vehicles, with performance metrics depicted in a graph showing significant fluctuations over time.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Auto Industry\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The Auto Industry category refers to the broader market segment that encompasses all automotive companies, with performance trends shown in comparison to Tesla.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"S&P 500\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The S&P 500 is a stock market index that represents the performance of 500 large companies, serving as a benchmark for the overall market performance.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Q3 2023\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Q3 2023 marks the third quarter of the year 2023, during which performance metrics for Tesla, the Auto Industry, and the S&P 500 were analyzed.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Q2 2021\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Q2 2021 refers to the second quarter of the year 2021, highlighting a peak in Tesla's performance metrics.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla\\\"<|>\\\"Auto Industry\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla's performance is compared to the overall Auto Industry, highlighting its volatility against a more stable industry average.\\\"<|>\\\"performance comparison, market trends\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla\\\"<|>\\\"S&P 500\\\"<|>\\\"The performance of Tesla is analyzed in relation to the S&P 500, indicating how it contrasts with broader market growth trends.\\\"<|>\\\"market performance, investor analysis\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Auto Industry\\\"<|>\\\"S&P 500\\\"<|>\\\"The Auto Industry's performance trends are evaluated alongside the S&P 500, providing insight into industry versus market performance.\\\"<|>\\\"sector performance, economic indicators\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla\\\"<|>\\\"Q2 2021\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla's performance peaked in Q2 2021, a significant temporal marker in the analysis of its metrics.\\\"<|>\\\"performance peak, event significance\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla\\\"<|>\\\"Q3 2023\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla's performance metric is depicted up to Q3 2023, indicating a decline from its previously high performance.\\\"<|>\\\"temporal analysis, performance decline\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"Tesla performance, market trends, automotive industry, S&P 500 comparison, quarterly analysis\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
