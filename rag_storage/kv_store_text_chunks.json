While production cost at our new factories remained higher than our established factories, we have implemented necessary upgrades in Q3 to enable further unit cost reductions. We continue to believe that an industry leader needs to be a cost leader. \n\nDuring a high interest rate environment, we believe focusing on investments in R&D and capital expenditures for future growth, while maintaining positive free cash flow, is the right approach. Year-to-date, our free cash flow reached \\$2.3B while our cash and investments position continues to improve. \n\nWe have more than doubled the size of our AI training compute to accommodate for our growing dataset as well as our Optimus robot project. Our humanoid robot is currently being trained for simple tasks through AI rather than hard-coded software, and its hardware is being further upgraded. \n\nLastly, with a combined gross profit generation of over \\$0.5B in Q3, our Energy Generation and Storage business and Services and Other business have become meaningful contributors to our profitability. \n\nRevenue \n\nTotal revenue grew $9 \\%$ YoY in Q3 to $\\$ 23,45$ . YoY, revenue was impacted by the following items: \n\n$^ +$ growth in vehicle deliveries   \n$^ +$ growth in other parts of the business   \n- reduced average selling price (ASP) YoY (excluding FX impact)   \n- negative $\\mathsf { F X }$ impact of $\\$ 0.45$ \n\nProfitability \n\nOur operating income decreased YoY to $\\$ 1.8 B$ in Q3, resulting in a $7 . 6 \\%$ operating margin. YoY, operating income was primarily impacted by the following items: \n\n- reduced ASP due to pricing and mix   \n- increase in operating expenses driven by Cybertruck, AI and other R&D projects   \n- cost of production ramp and idle cost related to factory upgrades   \n- negative FX impact   \n$^ +$ growth in vehicle deliveries (despite the margin headwind from underutilization from new factories)   \n$^ +$ lower cost per vehicle and IRA credit benefit   \n$^ +$ gross profit growth in Energy Generation and Storage as well as Services and Other   \n$^ +$ growth in regulatory credit sales \n\nCash \n\nDuring the quarter we brought down several production lines for upgrades at various factories, which led to a sequential decline in production volumes. We made further progress smoothing out the delivery rate across the quarter, with September accounting for ${ \\sim } 4 0 \\%$ of Q3 deliveries this year, compared to September accounting for $\\sim 6 5 \\%$ of Q3 deliveries in 2022. \n\nAt Gigafactory Texas, we began pilot production of the Cybertruck, which remains on track for initial deliveries this year. We are expecting the Model Y production rate in Texas to grow very gradually from its current level as we ramp additional supply chain needs in a cost-efficient manner. Production of our higher density 4680 cell is progressing as planned, and we continue building capacity for cathode production and lithium refining in the U.S. \n\nUS: California, Nevada and Texas \n\nChina: Shanghai \n\nOther than scheduled downtime in Q3, our Shanghai factory has been successfully running near full capacity for several quarters, and we do not expect a meaningful increase in weekly production run rate. Giga Shanghai remains our main export hub. \n\nEurope: Berlin-Brandenburg \n\nModel Y remained the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Europe year-to-date (based on the latest available data as of August). Similar to Texas, further production ramp of Model Y will be gradual. \n\nArtificial Intelligence Software and Hardware \n\nSoftware that safely performs tasks in the real world is the key focus of our AI development efforts. We have commissioned one of the world's largest supercomputers to accelerate the pace of our AI development, with compute capacity more than doubling compared to Q2. Our large installed base of vehicles continues to generate anonymized video and other data used to develop our FSD Capability features. \n\nVehicle and Other Software \n\nAll Tesla rentals through Hertz in the U.S. and Canada now allow Tesla app access, allowing renters to use keyless lock/unlock via phone key, remotely precondition the cabin, track charge status and more. Customers who already have a Tesla Profile will have their settings and preferences seamlessly applied, making the rental car feel like their own. The in-app service experience was also redesigned to allow customers to schedule service, access their loaner, track service progress, pay and manage dropoff/pickup. Prospective customers can similarly schedule, locate and test drive a demo vehicle. \n\nBattery, Powertrain & Manufacturing \n\nDespite macroeconomic headwinds, our planned factory shutdowns in Q3 and ongoing ramp at new factories, our average vehicle cost was $\\sim \\$ 37,",

Prospective customers can similarly schedule, locate and test drive a demo vehicle. \n\nBattery, Powertrain & Manufacturing \n\nDespite macroeconomic headwinds, our planned factory shutdowns in Q3 and ongoing ramp at new factories, our average vehicle cost was $\\sim \\$ 37,500$ , and we continue to work to reduce the cost further. For very heavy vehicles, a high voltage powertrain architecture brings notable cost savings, which is why Cybertruck will adopt an 800-volt architecture. \n\nEnergy Storage \n\nEnergy storage deployments increased by $90 \\%$ YoY in Q3 to 4.0 GWh, our highest quarterly deployment ever. Continued growth in deployments was driven by the ongoing ramp of our Megafactory in Lathrop, CA toward full capacity of 40 GWh with the phase two expansion. Production rate improved further sequentially in Q3. \n\nSolar \n\nSolar deployments declined on a sequential and YoY basis to 49 MW. Sustained high interest rates and the end of net metering in California have created downward pressure on solar demand. \n\nServices and Other business \n\nAs our global fleet size grows, our Services and Other business continues to grow successfully, with Supercharging, insurance and body shop & part sales being the core drivers of profit growth YoY. Pay-per-use Supercharging remains a profitable business for the company, even as we scale capital expenditures. Our team is focused on materially expanding Supercharging capacity and further improving capacity management in anticipation of other OEMs joining our network. \n\ne are planning to grow production as quickly as possible in alignment with the $50 \\%$ CAGR target we began guiding to early 2021. In some years we may grow faster and some we may grow slower, depending on a number of factors. For 23, we expect to remain ahead of the long-term $50 \\%$ CAGR with around 1.8 million vehicles for the year. \n\nWe have ample liquidity to fund our product roadmap, long-term capacity expansion plans and other expenses.   \nFurthermore, we will manage the business such that we maintain a strong balance sheet during this uncertain period. \n\nWhile we continue to execute on innovations to reduce the cost of manufacturing and operations, over time, we expect our hardware-related profits to be accompanied by an acceleration of AI, software and fleet-based profits. \n\nCybertruck deliveries remain on track for later this year. In addition, we continue to make progress on our next generation platform. \n\nP H O T O S & C H A R T S \n\nF I N A N C I A L S T A T E M E N T S \n\nWEBCAST INFORMATION \n\nTesla will provide a live webcast of its third quarter 2023 financial results conference call beginning at 4:30 p.m. CT on October 18, 2023 at ir.tesla.com. This webcast will also be available for replay for approximately one year thereafter. \n\nCERTAIN TERMS \n\nWhen used in this update, certain terms have the following meanings. Our vehicle deliveries include only vehicles that have been transferred to end customers with all paperwork correctly completed. Our energy product deployment volume includes both customer units installed and equipment sales; we report installations at time of commissioning for storage projects or inspection for solar projects, and equipment sales at time of delivery. \"Adjusted EBITDA\" is equal to (i) net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before (ii)(a) interest expense, (b) provision for income taxes, (c) depreciation, amortization and impairment and (d) stock-based compensation expense, which is the same measurement for this term pursuant to the performance-based stock option award granted to our CEO in 2018. \"Free cash flow\" is operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Average cost per vehicle is cost of automotive sales divided by new vehicle deliveries (excluding operating leases). “Days sales outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts receivable, net for the period divided by (ii) total revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days payable outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts payable for the period divided by (ii) total cost of revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days of supply” is calculated by dividing new car ending inventory by the relevant quarter’s deliveries and using 75 trading days. Constant currency impacts are calculated by comparing actuals against current results converted nto USD using average exchange rates from the prior period. \n\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION \n\nConsolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non-GAAP basis to supplement our consolidated financial results. Our non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a diluted per share basis (calculated using weighted average shares for GAAP diluted net income (loss) ttributable to common stockholders), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to Tesla’s historical performance as well as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. Management believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non-GAAP information because management uses such information nternally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial ondition and results of operations, so that investors can see through the eyes of Tesla management regarding important financial metrics that Tesla uses to run the business and allowing investors to better understand Tesla’s performance.

The column headers include 'Q3-2022', 'Q4-2022', 'Q1-2023', 'Q2-2023', and 'Q3-2023,' showcasing the company's financial trajectory over this period. Key data points demonstrate a decline in total gross profit and overall profitability, evidenced by a decrease in net income and earnings per share compared to the prior year. Notably, total revenues in Q3-2023 were reported at \\$23.35 billion, reflecting a 9% YoY growth, primarily driven by automotive revenue growth and energy generation and storage revenue which grew by 40%. Despite this revenue growth, the gross profit fell by 22%, indicating increased costs and pressures on margins due to factors like higher operating expenses related to R&D and production ramp-up at new factories. The table shows that Q3's operating margin dropped to 7.6%, highlighting a significant decline and reflecting the impact of reduced average selling prices and underutilization of production capacity. The relationship between operating expenses and revenues suggests that while revenue generation remains robust, cost management plays a critical role in profitability. Overall, the financial underperformance illustrated in the table aligns with the strategic focus on reducing vehicle costs and investing in growth projects outlined in the surrounding content, indicating an intent to balance investments with profitability management in a challenging economic environment.",

Production rates depend on a variety of factors, including equipment uptime, component supply, downtime related to factory upgrades, regulatory considerations and other factors. \n\nAnalysis: The table titled 'Current Installed Annual Vehicle Capacity' provides a structured overview of Tesla's production capabilities across different regions. It comprises four columns: 'Region', 'Model', 'Capacity', and 'Status'. The 'Region' column lists locations such as California, Shanghai, Berlin, Texas, and Nevada, indicating where production is taking place or planned. The 'Model' column details the specific vehicle models, including the Model S, Model X, Model 3, Model Y, Cybertruck, and Tesla Semi. The 'Capacity' column specifies the annual production capacity, with notable figures like over 950,000 for Shanghai's Model 3 and Model Y, and 550,000 for California's Model 3 and Model Y. The 'Status' column reveals whether the vehicles are in active production or in pilot production status. A significant insight is the 'Pilot production' status for the Cybertruck and Tesla Semi, indicating that Tesla is gradually ramping production in response to supply chain optimizations mentioned in the surrounding context. This aligns with the company’s strategic focus on increasing production rates while managing factory upgrades efficiently. The relationships highlighted in the data suggest that Tesla is heavily investing in its production capacity, especially in regions critical to its operations, such as Shanghai, which serves as a major hub for exports. The connection between production capacity and strategic delivery goals is also evident—given that the production rates play a critical role in meeting customer demand and achieving delivery targets, as illustrated by the reduction in the percentage of Q3 deliveries in September compared to the previous year. Ultimately, the table underscores Tesla's ambitious plans amidst various operational challenges and is integral to understanding how Tesla intends to align production with its long-term objectives.",

The bars, which are a deep blue, illustrate a steady increase over the quarters, with noticeable spikes in certain periods. On the right side, two distinct metrics—Operating Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow—are displayed, both measured in billions of dollars. The y-axis on this side ranges from 0 to 6. The Operating Cash Flow, represented by taller blue bars, shows fluctuations across quarters, peaking in Q2 2022 and Q3 2022. Meanwhile, the Free Cash Flow, depicted in a maroon hue, experiences lower counts, revealing a more erratic pattern. Each bar has labels for the respective quarters, clearly marked beneath each grouping. The overall color scheme is professional with a muted background, emphasizing the blue and maroon bars. The layout is clean, with sufficient spacing to distinguish between the two graphs and their respective data points.",

The vertical axis measures percentage growth, marked from -20% to 90%, while the horizontal axis is divided into quarterly time intervals over the specified period. There are three distinct lines representing the revenue growth for each entity: Tesla is shown in a bold red, the Auto Industry in gray, and the S&P 500 in blue. The red line starts below the gray line in Q3 2019, dips and shows volatility, then peaks significantly around Q2 2021 before declining again towards Q3 2023, reflecting Tesla's sharp growth trajectory followed by a reduction. The gray line representing the Auto Industry maintains a flatter, steadier progression, peaking mildly around the same time as Tesla, but without the same volatility. The blue line for the S&P 500 hovers consistently above the other two lines with minor fluctuations, indicating overall stable growth relative to Tesla and the Auto Industry. The colors used are contrasting, with a clean, minimalistic style that emphasizes clarity. There are no labels directly marking the lines but the colors correspond clearly with the legends implied by their colors. The graph is informative, encapsulating Tesla’s performance against industry standards and stock market performance, relevant to financial statements for stakeholders.",

The table is structured with column headers indicating time periods in the fiscal year, while the first column lists significant financial components such as total revenues, gross profit, and net income. Notable data points include total revenues peaking at $24,927 million in Q2-2023 before declining to $23,350 million in Q3-2023, indicating a potential seasonal trend. Cost of revenues mirrors this pattern, with automotive sales costs stabilizing around $15,656 million in Q3-2023. Furthermore, net income reflects considerable fluctuations; it sharply dropped from $3,292 million in Q3-2022 to $1,853 million in Q3-2023, suggesting operational challenges or increased expenditures. The detail on net income per share, both basic and diluted, reveals discrepancies in earnings attributable to shared ownership during this period. This exploration of Tesla’s financial metrics is significant in highlighting the impact of operational choices and market pressures on profitability within the evolving landscape of the electric vehicle sector, making these insights pertinent to investors and stakeholders who analyze overarching financial trends.",

The table consists of two main sections: Assets and Liabilities & Equity, detailing the financial position across different periods. Column headers indicate date references for financial metrics, and rows summarize various asset types, liabilities, and shareholders' equity. Notable insights reveal increasing total current assets, particularly cash equivalents rising from 21.107 million USD to 26.077 million USD (Q3 2023), and a fluctuating inventory which peaked at 14.375 million USD in Q1 2023 before dropping back to 13.721 million USD by Q3 2023. Total liabilities show a consistent increase over the quarters, culminating in 39.446 million USD by Q3 2023, while total stockholders' equity demonstrated robust growth from 39.851 million USD to 53.466 million USD in the same period, indicating a strengthening financial position. The days sales outstanding remained relatively stable, signaling efficient accounts receivable management, while days payable outstanding saw some variances, indicating fluctuations in payment terms with suppliers. This data reflects overall company growth, stronger liquidity, and possibly improved operational efficiency.",

The second to sixth columns represent quarterly figures, revealing notable trends. Key insights include a consistent decline in net income from Q3-2022 (3,331) to Q3-2023 (1,878), a slight increase in cash from operational activities at Q3-2023 (3,308) compared to Q2-2023 (3,065), and a notable escalatory trend in capital expenditures reaching (2,460) in Q3-2023. Additionally, financing activities show fluctuating patterns with a positive net flow of 254 in Q3-2023. The relationships among net income, operational cash flow, and capital expenditures suggest that increasing investments could be impacting net income negatively. Therefore, examining how expenditures correlate with net income decreases may yield insights for strategic adjustments going forward.",

Key data points include a steady increase in net income attributable to common stockholders, which rose from $16 million in Q1 2020 to $2,703 million in Q3 2023. This significant growth pattern illustrates improving profitability over time, which correlates with the context of Tesla's strong market position and production ramp-up in electric vehicles. Trends indicate fluctuations in capital expenditures and consistent growth in adjusted EBITDA, peaking at $5,404 million in Q2 2023, showcasing operational efficiency. The data serves to support surrounding content discussing Tesla's robust growth amid market uncertainties and increasing demand for electric vehicles, and the importance of understanding both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for a comprehensive view of financial health.",
