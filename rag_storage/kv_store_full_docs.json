While production cost at our new factories remained higher than our established factories, we have implemented necessary upgrades in Q3 to enable further unit cost reductions. We continue to believe that an industry leader needs to be a cost leader. \n\nDuring a high interest rate environment, we believe focusing on investments in R&D and capital expenditures for future growth, while maintaining positive free cash flow, is the right approach. Year-to-date, our free cash flow reached \\$2.3B while our cash and investments position continues to improve. \n\nWe have more than doubled the size of our AI training compute to accommodate for our growing dataset as well as our Optimus robot project. Our humanoid robot is currently being trained for simple tasks through AI rather than hard-coded software, and its hardware is being further upgraded. \n\nLastly, with a combined gross profit generation of over \\$0.5B in Q3, our Energy Generation and Storage business and Services and Other business have become meaningful contributors to our profitability. \n\nRevenue \n\nTotal revenue grew $9 \\%$ YoY in Q3 to $\\$ 23,45$ . YoY, revenue was impacted by the following items: \n\n$^ +$ growth in vehicle deliveries   \n$^ +$ growth in other parts of the business   \n- reduced average selling price (ASP) YoY (excluding FX impact)   \n- negative $\\mathsf { F X }$ impact of $\\$ 0.45$ \n\nProfitability \n\nOur operating income decreased YoY to $\\$ 1.8 B$ in Q3, resulting in a $7 . 6 \\%$ operating margin. YoY, operating income was primarily impacted by the following items: \n\n- reduced ASP due to pricing and mix   \n- increase in operating expenses driven by Cybertruck, AI and other R&D projects   \n- cost of production ramp and idle cost related to factory upgrades   \n- negative FX impact   \n$^ +$ growth in vehicle deliveries (despite the margin headwind from underutilization from new factories)   \n$^ +$ lower cost per vehicle and IRA credit benefit   \n$^ +$ gross profit growth in Energy Generation and Storage as well as Services and Other   \n$^ +$ growth in regulatory credit sales \n\nCash \n\nDuring the quarter we brought down several production lines for upgrades at various factories, which led to a sequential decline in production volumes. We made further progress smoothing out the delivery rate across the quarter, with September accounting for ${ \\sim } 4 0 \\%$ of Q3 deliveries this year, compared to September accounting for $\\sim 6 5 \\%$ of Q3 deliveries in 2022. \n\nAt Gigafactory Texas, we began pilot production of the Cybertruck, which remains on track for initial deliveries this year. We are expecting the Model Y production rate in Texas to grow very gradually from its current level as we ramp additional supply chain needs in a cost-efficient manner. Production of our higher density 4680 cell is progressing as planned, and we continue building capacity for cathode production and lithium refining in the U.S. \n\nUS: California, Nevada and Texas \n\nChina: Shanghai \n\nOther than scheduled downtime in Q3, our Shanghai factory has been successfully running near full capacity for several quarters, and we do not expect a meaningful increase in weekly production run rate. Giga Shanghai remains our main export hub. \n\nEurope: Berlin-Brandenburg \n\nModel Y remained the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Europe year-to-date (based on the latest available data as of August). Similar to Texas, further production ramp of Model Y will be gradual. \n\nArtificial Intelligence Software and Hardware \n\nSoftware that safely performs tasks in the real world is the key focus of our AI development efforts. We have commissioned one of the world's largest supercomputers to accelerate the pace of our AI development, with compute capacity more than doubling compared to Q2. Our large installed base of vehicles continues to generate anonymized video and other data used to develop our FSD Capability features. \n\nVehicle and Other Software \n\nAll Tesla rentals through Hertz in the U.S. and Canada now allow Tesla app access, allowing renters to use keyless lock/unlock via phone key, remotely precondition the cabin, track charge status and more. Customers who already have a Tesla Profile will have their settings and preferences seamlessly applied, making the rental car feel like their own. The in-app service experience was also redesigned to allow customers to schedule service, access their loaner, track service progress, pay and manage dropoff/pickup. Prospective customers can similarly schedule, locate and test drive a demo vehicle. \n\nBattery, Powertrain & Manufacturing \n\nDespite macroeconomic headwinds, our planned factory shutdowns in Q3 and ongoing ramp at new factories, our average vehicle cost was $\\sim \\$ 37,500$ , and we continue to work to reduce the cost further. For very heavy vehicles, a high voltage powertrain architecture brings notable cost savings, which is why Cybertruck will adopt an 800-volt architecture. \n\nEnergy Storage \n\nEnergy storage deployments increased by $90 \\%$ YoY in Q3 to 4.0 GWh, our highest quarterly deployment ever. Continued growth in deployments was driven by the ongoing ramp of our Megafactory in Lathrop, CA toward full capacity of 40 GWh with the phase two expansion. Production rate improved further sequentially in Q3. \n\nSolar \n\nSolar deployments declined on a sequential and YoY basis to 49 MW. Sustained high interest rates and the end of net metering in California have created downward pressure on solar demand. \n\nServices and Other business \n\nAs our global fleet size grows, our Services and Other business continues to grow successfully, with Supercharging, insurance and body shop & part sales being the core drivers of profit growth YoY. Pay-per-use Supercharging remains a profitable business for the company, even as we scale capital expenditures. Our team is focused on materially expanding Supercharging capacity and further improving capacity management in anticipation of other OEMs joining our network. \n\ne are planning to grow production as quickly as possible in alignment with the $50 \\%$ CAGR target we began guiding to early 2021. In some years we may grow faster and some we may grow slower, depending on a number of factors. For 23, we expect to remain ahead of the long-term $50 \\%$ CAGR with around 1.8 million vehicles for the year. \n\nWe have ample liquidity to fund our product roadmap, long-term capacity expansion plans and other expenses.   \nFurthermore, we will manage the business such that we maintain a strong balance sheet during this uncertain period. \n\nWhile we continue to execute on innovations to reduce the cost of manufacturing and operations, over time, we expect our hardware-related profits to be accompanied by an acceleration of AI, software and fleet-based profits. \n\nCybertruck deliveries remain on track for later this year. In addition, we continue to make progress on our next generation platform. \n\nP H O T O S & C H A R T S \n\nF I N A N C I A L S T A T E M E N T S \n\nWEBCAST INFORMATION \n\nTesla will provide a live webcast of its third quarter 2023 financial results conference call beginning at 4:30 p.m. CT on October 18, 2023 at ir.tesla.com. This webcast will also be available for replay for approximately one year thereafter. \n\nCERTAIN TERMS \n\nWhen used in this update, certain terms have the following meanings. Our vehicle deliveries include only vehicles that have been transferred to end customers with all paperwork correctly completed. Our energy product deployment volume includes both customer units installed and equipment sales; we report installations at time of commissioning for storage projects or inspection for solar projects, and equipment sales at time of delivery. \"Adjusted EBITDA\" is equal to (i) net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before (ii)(a) interest expense, (b) provision for income taxes, (c) depreciation, amortization and impairment and (d) stock-based compensation expense, which is the same measurement for this term pursuant to the performance-based stock option award granted to our CEO in 2018. \"Free cash flow\" is operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Average cost per vehicle is cost of automotive sales divided by new vehicle deliveries (excluding operating leases). “Days sales outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts receivable, net for the period divided by (ii) total revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days payable outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts payable for the period divided by (ii) total cost of revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days of supply” is calculated by dividing new car ending inventory by the relevant quarter’s deliveries and using 75 trading days. Constant currency impacts are calculated by comparing actuals against current results converted nto USD using average exchange rates from the prior period. \n\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION \n\nConsolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non-GAAP basis to supplement our consolidated financial results. Our non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a diluted per share basis (calculated using weighted average shares for GAAP diluted net income (loss) ttributable to common stockholders), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to Tesla’s historical performance as well as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. Management believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non-GAAP information because management uses such information nternally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial ondition and results of operations, so that investors can see through the eyes of Tesla management regarding important financial metrics that Tesla uses to run the business and allowing investors to better understand Tesla’s performance. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be read in conjunction with financial information reported under U.S. GAAP when understanding Tesla’s operating performance. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is provided above. \n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS \n\nCertain statements in this update, including statements in the “Outlook” section; statements relating to the future development, ramp, production and capacity, demand and market growth, cost, pricing and profitability, investment, deliveries, deployment, availability and other features and improvements and timing of existing and future Tesla products and technologies such as Model 3, Model Y, Model X, Model S, Cybertruck, our next generation vehicle platform, our Dojo training computers, our Autopilot, Full Self-Driving and other vehicle software and AI enabled products, our battery cells, our Supercharging network and our energy storage and solar products; statements regarding operating margin, operating profits, spending and liquidity; and statements regarding expansion, improvements and/or ramp and related timing at our factories are “forward-looking statements” that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations, and as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those projected.

This webcast will also be available for replay for approximately one year thereafter.\n\nCERTAIN TERMS\n\nWhen used in this update, certain terms have the following meanings. Our vehicle deliveries include only vehicles that have been transferred to end customers with all paperwork correctly completed. Our energy product deployment volume includes both customer units installed and equipment sales; we report installations at time of commissioning for storage projects or inspection for solar projects, and equipment sales at time of delivery. \"Adjusted EBITDA\" is equal to (i) net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before (ii)(a) interest expense, (b) provision for income taxes, (c) depreciation, amortization and impairment and (d) stock-based compensation expense, which is the same measurement for this term pursuant to the performance-based stock option award granted to our CEO in 2018. \"Free cash flow\" is operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Average cost per vehicle is cost of automotive sales divided by new vehicle deliveries (excluding operating leases). 'Days sales outstanding' is equal to (i) average accounts receivable, net for the period divided by (ii) total revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. 'Days payable outstanding' is equal to (i) average accounts payable for the period divided by (ii) total cost of revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. 'Days of supply' is calculated by dividing new car ending inventory by the relevant quarter's deliveries and using 75 trading days. Constant currency impacts are calculated by comparing actuals against current results converted into USD using average exchange rates from the prior period.\n\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\n\nConsolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non-GAAP basis to supplement our consolidated financial results. Our non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a diluted per share basis (calculated using weighted average shares for GAAP diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Tesla's historical performance as well as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. Management believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non-GAAP information because management uses such information internally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations, so that investors can see through the eyes of Tesla management regarding important financial metrics that Tesla uses to run the business and allowing investors to better understand Tesla's performance. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be read in conjunction with financial information reported under U.S. GAAP when understanding Tesla's operating performance. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is provided above.\n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nCertain statements in this update, including statements in the 'Outlook' section; statements relating to the future development, ramp, production and capacity, demand and market growth, cost, pricing and profitability, investment, deliveries, deployment, availability and other features and improvements and timing of existing and future Tesla products and technologies such as Model 3, Model Y, Model X, Model S, Cybertruck, our next generation vehicle platform, our Dojo training computers, our Autopilot, Full Self-Driving and other vehicle software and AI enabled products, our battery cells, our Supercharging network and our energy storage and solar products; statements regarding operating margin, operating profits, spending and liquidity; and statements regarding expansion, improvements and/or ramp and related timing at our factories are 'forward-looking statements' that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations, and as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those projected. The following important factors, without limitation, could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements: uncertainties in future macroeconomic and regulatory conditions arising from the current global pandemic; the risk of delays in launching and manufacturing our products and features cost-effectively; our ability to grow our sales, delivery, installation, servicing and charging capabilities and effectively manage this growth; consumers' demand for electric vehicles generally and our vehicles specifically; the ability of suppliers to deliver components according to schedules, prices, quality and volumes acceptable to us, and our ability to manage such components effectively; any issues with lithium-ion cells or other components manufactured at our factories; our ability to ramp our factories in accordance with our plans; our ability to procure supply of battery cells, including through our own manufacturing; risks relating to international expansion; any failures by Tesla products to perform as expected or if product recalls occur; the risk of product liability claims; competition in the automotive and energy product markets; our ability to maintain public credibility and confidence in our long-term business prospects; our ability to manage risks relating to our various product financing programs; the status of government and economic incentives for electric vehicles and energy products; our ability to attract, hire and retain key employees and qualified personnel and ramp our installation teams; our ability to maintain the security of our information and production and product systems; our compliance with various regulations and laws applicable to our operations and products, which may evolve from time to time; risks relating to our indebtedness and financing strategies; and adverse foreign exchange movements. More information on potential factors that could affect our financial results is included from time to time in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings and reports, including the risks identified under the section captioned 'Risk Factors' in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on January 31, 2023. Tesla disclaims any obligation to update information contained in these forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\n25",
